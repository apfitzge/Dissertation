  Until recently, whole-core neutronics calculations were carried out primarily through a two-step procedure.
  First, a transport method was used to compute homogenized cross section data for assemblies, and then 3-D diffusion was used to solve the problem.
  More recently, however, research has been focused on a one-step approach, so called direct whole-core transport.
  In such an approach, the 3-D reactor is directly modeled using transport methods.
  There are many different transport methods which are currently being researched; this chapter seeks to give an overview of several state-of-the-art 3-D transport methods.

  \section{Method of Characteristics}{\label{sec:3T:Method of Characteristics}
    The \acf{MOC} is a technique used in mathematics to solve \acp{PDE}, by transforming a \ac{PDE} into a system of \acp{ODE}.
    The method was first applied to the neutron transport problem by \citeauthor{Askew1972} in 1972 \cite{Askew1972}, but only began to see real use in the 1980's \cite{Halsall1980}.
    The \ac{MOC} transforms the transport equation into the characteristic form, by examining the equation along straight neutron paths through the spatial domain.

    By examining the equation along one of these characteristic ``tracks'' or ``rays'', the average angular flux along the track within a cell can be calculated.
    The scalar flux can then be found by collecting the average angular flux along all tracks passing through this region, in a numerical integration over space and angle.

    Like the \ac{CP} method, \ac{MOC} is able to handle completely arbitrary geometry; however, unlike the \ac{CP} method, it is also able to account for anisotropic scattering in a straightforward manner.
    Additionally, the \ac{MOC} does not produce the large matrices in realistic applications as the \ac{CP} method does.
    For problems that contain more than a few hundred cells, the \ac{MOC} is generally preferred over \ac{CP} methods \cite{Hebert2010}.

    The \ac{CDP} is a method similar to both \ac{CP} method and the \ac{MOC} \cite{Hong1999,Liu2014}.
    The \ac{CDP} uses ray-tracing to evaluate transmission probabilities between cells.
    However, it only considers transmission probabilities between cells which are traversed by a shared characteristic ray, rather than considering the transmission probability between all cells as in the \ac{CP} methods.
    This significantly cuts down on the computational resources required by traditional \ac{CP} methods.
    This method has also shown improvements over \ac{MOC} in cases with few unique geometries and constant material properties throughout the simulation; however these conditions are not applicable in problems of interest to industry.

    The \ac{MOC} is the primary subject of this thesis work.
    As such, \cref{ch:The Method of Characteristics} has been devoted to the details of the method, and \cref{sec:3T:Ray-Tracing} expands upon the details of current ray-tracing techniques used in \ac{MOC}.
    \Cref{ch:Improved Linear Source Formulation for Multi-physics and 2D/1D Applications} details improvements made to the \ac{MOC} in this thesis work, and \cref{ch:MacroRay Three-Dimensional Ray-tracing Technique} details a newly investigated ray-tracing method.

  \section{Ray-Tracing}{\label{sec:3T:Ray-Tracing}
    The \acf{MOC} \cite{Askew1972} is based on solving the transport equation along many characteristic tracks or rays.
    These rays are followed through the reactor geometry in a process generally referred to as ``ray-tracing''.
    The placement and storage of these tracks is significant with respect to both calculation accuracy as well as computational performance.
    This section serves to give an overview of the current state-of-the-art ray-tracing methods used for \ac{MOC}-like transport calculations.

    \subsection{Modular Ray-Tracing}{\label{ssec:RT:Modular Ray-Tracing}
      The most straight-forward approach to perform a \ac{MOC} calculation is to create rays which span the domain of the transport problem being solved.
      However, in this approach, the information of each ray-segment must be stored, or computed on-the-fly.
      In large problems the number of ray-segments can become exceedingly large, and this approach is not feasible due to memory constraints.

      This led to the development of so-called ``modular'' ray-tracing methods \cite{Filippone1980,Saji2000,Wu2003,Kochunas2013}, in which the regularity of reactor designs is utilized to reduce memory usages.
      In typical reactor designs, certain geometries (like assemblies) are repeated throughout the core.
      Rather than laying tracks down for the global geometry, the transport problem is partitioned into ``modules'' which represent a small often repeated geometries in the problem.
      The ray-tracing data is generated for each module, in such a way there is direct linking of tracks on module interfaces; this is the \ac{DNPL} technique devised by \citet{Saji2000}.
      This significantly reduces the amount of ray-tracing data that needs to be stored in \ac{MOC} calculations, and has been widely adopted in \ac{MOC} transport codes \cite{Hong1998,Jung2009,Tang2009,DeCART,APOLLO3,MPACT2016,Hebert2017a}.
      Tracks spanning the global domain are then constructed by connecting multiple modular rays, as is depicted in \cref{fig:MRT:Modular Ray Tracing}.

      \begin{figure}[h]
          \centering
          \def\svgwidth{0.4\linewidth}
          \input{\figpath/ModularRayTracing.pdf_tex}
          \caption{Depiction of modular ray-tracing method. Global (long) rays can be constructed by connecting multiple modular rays, as is shown in red.}
          \label{fig:MRT:Modular Ray Tracing}
      \end{figure}

      The modular ray-tracing technique, with \ac{DNPL}, requires that the number of tracks on a modular boundary is an integer.
      This additionally requires that all modules have the same spatial dimensions, given by the pitches $P_x$ and $P_y$, and that the spacing between all tracks in a direction are constant.
      Let $\tA[a0]$ be the desired ray-spacing for an azimuthal angle $a$, and $\Azimuthal_{a0}$ be the desired azimuthal angle.
      The number of rays on the $x$ and $y$ module boundaries can be determined as
      \begin{subequations}\label[subeqs]{eqs:MRT:Nx/y}
          \begin{equation}\label{eq:MRT:Nx}
              N_x = \ceil*{\frac{P_x \sin(\Azimuthal_{a0})}{\tA[a0]}},
          \end{equation}
          and
          \begin{equation}\label{eq:MRT:Ny}
              N_y = \ceil*{\frac{P_x \cos(\Azimuthal_{a0})}{\tA[a0]}}.
          \end{equation}
      \end{subequations}
      The $x$ and $y$ distance between rays can be determined by
      \begin{subequations}\label[subeqs]{eqs:MRT:x/y ray-spacing}
          \begin{equation}\label{eq:MRT:x ray-spacing}
              \delta_x = \frac{P_x}{N_x},
          \end{equation}
          and
          \begin{equation}\label{eq:MRT:y ray-spacing}
              \delta_y = \frac{P_y}{N_y}.
          \end{equation}
      \end{subequations}
      The azimuthal angle is then ``corrected'' to represent the true angle at which the rays are placed,
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:MRT:Azimuthal Correction}
          \Azimuthal_{a} = \tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{\delta_y}{\delta_x}\right),
      \end{equation}
      and the corrected ray-spacing is then given by
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:MRT:Corrected Radial Ray-Spacing}
          \tA[a] = \delta_x \sin(\Azimuthal_{a}).
      \end{equation}

      Due to the constraint of \ac{DNPL}, the directional quadrature is perturbed in the process of ray-tracing.
      As described in \cref{ssec:MOC:FSA:Particle Conservation}, this has implications on particle conservation in calculations.
      To maintain accuracy, a higher-order directional quadrature may need to be used would otherwise have been necessary.
    }

    \subsection{Mobile Chords}{\label{ssec:RT:Mobile Chords}
      The mobile chord method was introduced by \citet{Villarino1992} in the HELIOS code for \ac{CP} calculations, and adapted to the \ac{MOC} by \citet{Yamamoto2008}.
      In the typical equidistant ray-tracing method, a ray is placed at the center of the ray-width.
      The mobile chord method offsets the ray from the center, with differing offsets in each direction.
      This has generally shown to be more accurate than the typical equidistant ray-tracing method \cite{Yamamoto2008}, but is not directly compatible with the \ac{DNPL} technique.
      While ray widths are still linked, the ray-traces are not; though, this does not seem to introduce significant discretization errors \cite{Yamamoto2008}.
    }

    \subsection{Macroband}{\label{ssec:RT:Macroband}
      The \emph{macroband} method  was originally proposed by \citet{Villarino1992} for \ac{CP} calculations in HELIOS.
      In this method, characteristic rays placed within ``macrobands'' which are separated by tangential and intersection points in the mesh.
      There is no material or geometric discontinuities within each macroband segment (macrosegment), and thus the direction-of-flight averaged angular flux in each macrosegment is smooth with regards to the transverse direction.
      Since integration in the \ac{MOC} is akin to a quadrature integration, this indicates that a more advanced quadrature, for ray placement and width, can be used to reduce discretization error \cite{Yamamoto2005}.

        \label{fig:RT:Equidisant vs Macroband}
      \end{figure}

      The \ac{MRT} ray-tracing technique does not consider the internal geometry when laying down tracks.
      For a specified ray-spacing and module size, the tracks are the same regardless of the internal mesh.
      The macroband takes an entirely different approach, and the internal mesh is the primary guide for laying down the tracks.

      Macrobands are determined by the computational mesh; for large heterogeneous assemblies, this results in very thin macrobands, which would result in significantly increased computation time.
      In the related \ac{CDP} \citet{Hong1999} proposed that macroband ray-tracing data only be generated on unique subsystems.
      Similarly, \citet{Yamamoto2005} proposed the \ac{MRMB} in which macroband ray-tracing data is only generated for unit-cells.
      These techniques are similar to the modular ray-tracing technique in that ray-tracing data is only generated for unique subsystems, which significantly reduces the amount of ray-tracing data.
      The macroband ray-tracing process is displayed for a single pin-cell mesh in \cref{fig:RT:Macroband Process}.

      \end{figure}

      However, these techniques are fundamentally incompatible with the \ac{DNPL} technique, at thus an approximation of angular flux must be made on subsystem interfaces.
      \citet{Yamamoto2005} proposed linearly interpolating the angular flux on cell boundaries, though other techniques involving averaging the angular flux on sub-boundaries have been utilized in the \ac{CDP} \cite{Liu2014}.
      Alternatively, these methods do not require adjustment to the angular quadrature.

      \citet{Yamamoto2005} found that the macroband method (using a Gauss-Legendre quadrature for ray placement), was more accurate than conventional ray-tracing methods with equidistant ray-spacing.
      \citet{Fevotte2007} proposed a new tracking technique similar to the macroband method, in which rays (placed equidistantly) are divided into sub-bands, which are effectively \emph{locally} projected macrobands, and the average flux of the sub-bands is propagated along each ray.
      Studies of ray-spacing with macroband, and \citetp{Fevotte2007} method, have indicated that coarser ray-spacing can be used while maintaining accuracy \cite{Yamamoto2005,Fevotte2007,Yamamoto2008}.

      \subsubsection{Interface Flux Approximations}{\label{sssec:RT:Interface Flux Approximations}
        The macroband ray-tracing method is fundamentally incompatible with \acf{DNPL}.
        Although ray-tracing can be performed on small unique subsystems, similarly to the \ac{MRT} method, the rays on module interfaces are no longer guaranteed to align.
        This makes it necessary for an approximation of the spatial dependence of the angular flux on these interfaces.
        However, there are multiple different options for performing this approximation.

        \citet{Yamamoto2005} proposed performing a linear of the flux on these interfaces.
        However, without adjustment, linear interpolation will not preserve the total flux passing through the surface; which is an important aspect when considering acceleration techniques such as \ac{CMFD}.
        For 3-D \ac{CDP} with uniformly spaced rays, \citet{Liu2014} proposed a sub-boundary averaging method.
        This method partitioned each interface into sub-boundaries, with the size depending on the interface and the direction; each sub-boundary represented a single angular flux value for each energy group, that was the average of the angular flux of all rays with centroids that intersected the sub-boundary.
        However, because only the centroids of each ray are considered using ray-spacing that is coarse compared to the sub-boundary size it not feasible.

        An earlier work \cite{Hong1999} used a similar 2-D sub-boundary averaging (though not directionally dependent); but rather than only considering the ray centroids, it considered the ``projection'' of rays.
        The ``projection'' being the area on the surface which would be intersected by the ray if it were infinite in length.
        Then, partial intersections of the projection and sub-boundaries are considered.
        This allows for coarse ray-spacing to be used without as much accuracy on the interfaces as the previously mentioned method.

        \Cref{fig:RT:2D SubBoundarySurfaceFlux} visually depicts the surface projections of 2-D rays on a single surface.
        This figure will be used as an example for the equations of this sub-boundary averaging method.
        $\psi_s^1$ should be a linear combination of the ray fluxes $\psi_r^1$ and $\psi_r^2$, based on their fractional areas, $A_1^1$ and $A_2^1$, respectively.
        Let us denote a sub-boundary as $S_i$ where $i$ is some index, and a ray projection as $R_j$ where $j$ is some index.
        We expect the surface flux to be a linear combination of the ray fluxes which intersect it; this can be expressed mathematically as
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:RT:SubBoundary Flux}
          \psi_s^i = \suml[j] \frac{A(S_i\cap R_j)}{A(S_i)}\psi_r^j,
        \end{equation}
        where $A$ denotes a function returning the area of the argument, and $\cap$ indicates the intersection of two objects.
        To show that this preserves the total neutron flux through the surface, consider the total flux through the surface
        \begin{aequation}\label{eq:RT:SubBoundary Flux Total}
          \psi_t &= \suml[i] A(S_i)\psi_s^i\\
                  &= \suml[i]A(S_i)\suml[j]\frac{A(S_i\cap R_j)}{A(S_i)}\psi_r^j\\
                  &= \suml[i]\suml[j]A(S_i\cap R_j)\psi_r^j\\
                  &= \suml[j]A(R_j)\psi_r^j,
        \end{aequation}
        where this last line is simply the summation of all ray fluxes.
        The reverse problem, computing the ray fluxes from the sub-boundary fluxes, is found to be
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:RT:Ray Flux}
          \psi_r^j = \suml[i] \frac{A(S_i\cap R_j)}{A(R_j)}\psi_s^i.
        \end{equation}
        \Cref{fig:RT:2D SubBoundarySurfaceFlux} also highlights a problem with only considering the centroids of each ray.
        Ray 2 is split nearly evenly between sub-boundaries 1 and 2.
        If only the centroids was considered, all ray 2's flux would be put into sub-boundary 2 and in the reverse direction all it's flux would come from sub-boundary 2.
        If the flux is relatively uniform along the surface direction, this is fine; however, if there are discontinuities in the flux then this can lead to considerable inaccuracies.

        \citet{Liu2014} did introduce a very useful concept to sub-boundary averaging, with the direction-dependence in the number of sub-boundaries on each surface.
        Rather than using a fixed number of sub-boundaries on each surface, it is expected that directions which are closer to being perpendicular to the surface will have larger variation, and thus need more sub-boundaries.
        The number of sub-boundaries on each surface can be computed using the dimensions of the surface, and the direction.
        Similarly to \ac{MRT}, the number of sub-boundaries on a surface is constrained to be an integer.
        The \ac{MRT} equations, \cref{eqs:MRT:Nx/y}, can be used to determine the number of sub-boundaries on the $x$ and $y$ surfaces.

    \subsection{Three-Dimensional Ray-Tracing Techniques}{\label{ssec:RT:Three-Dimensional Ray-Tracing Techniques}
      The \ac{MOC} is naturally extended to three-dimensional calculations along characteristic tracks spanning three-dimensions.
      However, 3-D \ac{MOC} presents significant computational challenges.
      This has led to significant research effort into developing more efficient approaches to three-dimensional \ac{MOC} \cite{Kochunas2013,Tramm2016,Yamamoto2017,Graziano2017,Gunow2017}.
      One of the main focuses of this research has been in reducing the complexity introduced by three-dimensional ray-tracing.

      \subsubsection{3-D Modular Ray-Tracing}{\label{sssec:RT:3D Modular Ray-Tracing}
        In three-dimensional \ac{MOC} calculations, characteristic rays must be laid down through the three-dimensional domain;
        Generally, three-dimensional tracks are generated by first creating a set to two-dimensional tracks, and generating three-dimensional tracks that project onto these two-dimensional tracks \cite{Kochunas2013,Shaner2015}.
        The generation of these two-dimensional tracks can be simplified as viewing each of the two-dimensional tracks as a plane in the axial and characteristic directions, $z$ and $\len$ respectively.
        Three-dimensional tracks are then produced by performing two-dimensional ray-tracing on this characteristic plane \cite{Kochunas2013}, as is shown in \cref{fig:RT:3-D Ray-tracing}

        \begin{figure}[h]
          \centering
          \def\svgwidth{0.85\linewidth}
          \input{\figpath/3D-raytracing.pdf_tex}
          \caption{3-D ray-tracing process. Generate 2-D tracks, these become characteristic planes. Along each plane, perform 2-D ray-tracing. The highlighted (red) characteristic track in the 2-D pin-cell on the left becomes the characteristic plane on the right.}
          \label{fig:RT:3-D Ray-tracing}
        \end{figure}

        There are subtleties in the generation of three-dimensional tracks, which have led to the development of different 3-D modular ray-tracing techniques \cite{Kochunas2013,Shaner2015}.
        Previous work had reported that direct use of the \ac{MRT} method in 3-D, required that tracks be stored separately for the forward and backward directions \cite{Kochunas2013};
        this has, however, been shown not to be the case \cite{Shaner2015}.
        The simplified \ac{MRT} was developed to avoid this issue \cite{Kochunas2013}, but generates significantly more characteristic tracks \cite{Shaner2015}.

        As discussed in \cref{ssec:RT:Modular Ray-Tracing}, 2-D \ac{MRT} perturbs the azimuthal angles in the directional quadrature to ensure \ac{DNPL}.
        For 3-D \ac{MRT}, this also perturbs the polar angles in the directional quadrature.
        \citet{Kochunas2013} also found that modularization of the directional quadratures led to clustering of the discrete directions, which introduces significant error in the integration of spherical harmonics moments \cite{Kochunas2013}, and has implications on particle conservation in anisotropic calculations (\cref{ssec:MOC:FSA:Particle Conservation}).
        In order to avoid this issue, the axial ray-spacing can be reduced until the modularized polar angle is only perturbed within some error criteria \cite{Kochunas2013}; however, this leads to significant increases in the number of tracks (and thus increases computational costs).
      }

    \subsection{Transport Sweeping with the Method of Characteristics}{\label{ssec:RT:Transport Sweeping with the Method of Characteristics}
      The \ac{MOC} is used to iteratively solve the transport equation, the iterations are generally referred to as \emph{transport sweeps}.
      For given boundary conditions and source, a transport sweep is used to compute estimates of the scalar flux and other moments using equations in the form \cref{eqs:MOC:FSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moments} for \ac{FSMOC} and \cref{eqs:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moments} for \ac{LSMOC}.
      This is an overly generalized description of a transport sweep, and there are considerations that arise from the different ray-tracing techniques discussed.

      In global ray-tracking procedures, calculations are most often carried out by examining a ray from end to end.
      The angular flux at the ends can be found from the boundary conditions.
      Along each segment, a transmission calculation can be carried out (\cref{eqs:MOC:FSA:Angular Flux Solution,eqs:MOC:LSA:Angular Flux Solution}), and flux moments can be accumulated.
      This procedure is shared by the \ac{MRT} which constructs global rays (long rays) by linking modular rays, as shown in \cref{fig:MRT:Modular Ray Tracing}.
      This allows for each ray calculation to be carried out in parallel, since each ray calculation is effectively independent \cite{Kochunas2013}; though special considerations must be taken to avoid race-conditions in the accumulation of moments.

      However, in the macroband method, transport sweeping is carried out in a different manner.
      It is not possible to generate a continuous characteristic track spanning the global domain when using \ac{MRMB} techniques.
      Thus, transport calculations are carried out in a pin-by-pin (assuming pins are the subsystems on which track data is generated) basis.
      For each pin calculation, boundary or interface angular flux can be computed as described in \cref{sssec:RT:Interface Flux Approximations}, and transmission/accumulation calculations are carried out by sweeping over the tracks.
      This can be done by considering each track separately, or by considering each macroband which are guaranteed to pass through the same regions.
      The angular flux on the exiting interface must be approximated, this can be done as described in \cref{sssec:RT:Interface Flux Approximations}.

      Pin-by-pin transport calculations must be carried out in a specific order, by considering the dependencies of angular flux.
      \Cref{fig:RT:Macroband Sweep Order} displays the sweeping order for a $2\times2$ array of pins in 2-D; this order is significantly different than the ray-by-ray order used in traditional \ac{MRT}-based \ac{MOC} calculations.
      Sweeping in this manner limits parallelism, though it may be possible to construct a dependency graph to get an optimal sweeping order considering macrorays individually, rather than on the pin-by-pin basis.
