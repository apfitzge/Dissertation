    \section{Fundamentals}{\label{sec:MOC:Fundamentals}
        The \acf{MOC} is a technique used in mathematics to solve \acp{PDE}, by transforming a \ac{PDE} into a system of \acp{ODE}.
        The method was first applied to the neutron transport problem by \citeauthor{Askew1972} in 1972 \cite{Askew1972}, but only began to see real use in the 1980's \cite{Halsall1980}.
        The \ac{MOC} transforms the transport equation into the characteristic form, by examining the equation along straight neutron paths through the spatial domain.
        For simplicity, the derivation of this method will begin with the multi-group \ac{SN} $k$-eigenvalue transport equation with spatially discretized mesh with constant material properties within each cell.
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:SSMGFS Transport}
            \left[\dirm\vdot\grad + \xst\right]\aflux[mi][g][\loc] = \rfourpi\source[mi][g][\loc],
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation*}
            \forall\loc\in\Region, \quad \forall m \in \angquad, \quad \forall i, g,
        \end{equation*}
        where $\Region$ is the spatial cell, $\angquad$ is the directional quadrature, as described in \cref{sssec:NTT:Directional Discretization}, and the fixed-source, $
        \source[mi][g][\loc]$ can be found by applying the discrete-to-moment operator, $\FluxToSource$, defined by
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Flux To Source Operator}
          \FluxToSource(f) \defined
            \suml[\gprime]\suml[\ell=0][L]\suml[n=-\ell][\ell]\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\xss[\ell]f^{\ell,\gprime}_{n,i}(\loc)
            + \frac{\spect}{\keff}\suml[\gprime]\nufis f^{\gprime}_{i}(\loc),
        \end{equation}
        to get
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Source}
            \source[mi][g][\loc] \defined
                \left[\suml[\gprime]\suml[\ell=0][L]\suml[n=-\ell][\ell]\SH\xss[\ell]\afluxmom(\loc) + \frac{\spect}{\keff}\suml[\gprime]\nufis\sflux[\gprime](\loc)\right].
        \end{equation}

        Consider a point, $\loc_0$, and a line passing through this point in direction $\dirm$.
        Any location along this \emph{characteristic} line (also referred to as a ray, or track), can be described as
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Characteristic Ray}
            \loc = \loc_0 + \len\dirm,
        \end{equation}
        where $\len$ is the distance along the track from $\loc_0$.
        Applying this transformation, \cref{eq:MOC:SSMGFS Transport} is put into the characteristic form
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Characteristic Form Deriv 1}
            \left[\deriv{}{\len} + \xst\right]\aflux[mi][g][\loc_0 + \len\dirm] = \rfourpi\source[mi][g][\loc_0 + \len\dirm].
        \end{equation}
        As described in \cref{sec:NTT:Neutron Transport Equation}, reactor physicists are generally interested in integrated angular flux quantities rather than the angular flux.
        It is thus typical in the \ac{MOC} to have many different characteristic tracks through our problem; in this work separate tracks will be subscripted with the index $k$.
        The characteristic form of the transport equation then becomes
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:MOC Equation Generic}
            \left[\deriv{}{\len} + \xst\right]\aflux = \rfourpi\source[mi][g][\len],
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation*}
            \forall \len \in [0,\segl], \forall m\in\angquad, \forall i,k,g,
        \end{equation*}
        where $\segl$ is the total length of the track-segment, as depicted in \cref{fig:MOC:MOC Coordinate System}.

        \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \def\svgwidth{0.4\linewidth}
            \input{\figpath/MOCCoordinateSystem.pdf_tex}
            \caption{Depiction of a single characteristic track through a cell $i$.}
            \label{fig:MOC:MOC Coordinate System}
        \end{figure}

        \Cref{eq:MOC:MOC Equation Generic} can be solved analytically along a characteristic track-segment using an integrating factor,
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Integrating Factor}
            M(\len) = \exp\!\left(\intl[0][\len]\xst\dif{s'}\right) = \exp\!\left(\opt\right),
        \end{equation}
        where the \emph{optical thickness}, $\opt$, is defined by
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Optical Thickness Definition}
            \opt \defined \xst\len.
        \end{equation}
        Using this integrating factor, the generic solution to the \ac{MOC} equation, given in \cref{eq:MOC:MOC Equation Generic}, is
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:MOC Generic Solution}
            \aflux = \afluxin\exp\!\left(-\opt\right) + \intl[0][\len]\rfourpi\source[mi][g][\len']\exp\!\left(-\xst\left[\len-\len'\right]\right)\dif{s'},
        \end{equation}
        where $\afluxin$ is the incident angular flux, $\aflux[mki][g][0]$.
        If a source shape is provided, \cref{eq:MOC:MOC Generic Solution} can be evaluated for every track-segment in the problem.
        The next subsection introduces formal methods to approximate the integration of quantities over both space and direction.
        These procedures can be used to determine the scalar flux or other quantities necessary in \ac{MOC} calculations.

        \subsection{Track-Based Integration}{\label{ssec:MOC:Track-Based Integration}
            Determining the angular flux along a single characteristic track is typically not very useful for reactor physics calculations.
            It is most often necessary to evaluate reaction rates, and therefore the scalar flux through integration of the angular flux.
            This section aims to provide a formal basis for the integration process used in the \ac{MOC} calculations in this work.

            \begin{figure}[h]
                \centering
                \def\svgwidth{0.4\linewidth}
                \input{\figpath/MOCTracks.pdf_tex}
                \caption{Example characteristic tracks (2D) through a cell for a single direction.}
                \label{fig:MOC:MOC Tracks}
            \end{figure}

            The \ac{MOC} is based on the \acf{SN} approximation; integration over the directional variable simply becomes a quadrature integration:
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Directional Quadrature Integration}
                \intl[\fourpi]f(\dir)\ddir \approx \fourpi\suml[m]\wt[m]f(\dirm).
            \end{equation}
            Within a cell, $\Region$, there are many characteristic track-segments in each direction in the directional quadrature, as is shown for a single direction in \cref{fig:MOC:MOC Tracks}.
            Thus, the spatial discretization is different for each direction, and spatial integration is linked with directional integration.
            For a single direction, the integration over the spatial domain can be approximated by the weighted summation of track-averaged values, with the weight being equal to the area of the track-segment.
            The average value of a function, $f(\loc,\dirm)$, along a track-segment is given as
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Track-Averaged Definition UnRenormalized}
                \MOCTrackIntegral{f(\loc,\dirm)} \defined \frac{1}{\segl}\intl[0][\segl]f(\len,\dirm)\dif{\len},
            \end{equation}
            where $\segl$ is the total length of the track-segment.
            The spatial integration for a single direction becomes
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Spatial Averaging Definition UnRenormalized}
                \frac{1}{V_i}\intl[\loc\in\Region]f(\loc,\dirm)\dif^3{\loc} \approx \MOCSingleAngleIntegral{f(\loc,\dirm)} \defined \frac{1}{V_i}\suml[k]\tA[mki]\segl\MOCTrackIntegral{f(\loc,\dirm)} ,
            \end{equation}
            where $\tA[mki]$ is the cross-sectional area of the track (width in 2D).
            In this notation, the integral is divided by the volume such that $\MOCSingleAngleIntegral{f}$ is approximately the mean value in the region, for the direction $\dirm$.
            Finally, an integration over both space and angle can be defined as
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Spatial and Directional Integration Definition}
                \MOCIntegral{f(\loc,\dir)} = \fourpi\suml[m]\wt[m]\MOCSingleAngleIntegral{f(\loc,\dirm)}.
            \end{equation}

            These integrations have been expressed as 3-D \ac{MOC} equations.
            For 2-D calculations, the form remains the same, except that in \cref{eq:MOC:Spatial Averaging Definition UnRenormalized}, which requires a scaling factor on the cell volume (now area):
            \begin{equation}
              \label{eq:MOC:Spatial Averaging Definition UnRenormalized 2D}
              \frac{1}{V_i}\intl[\loc\in\Region]f(\loc,\dirm)\dif^3{\loc} \approx \MOCSingleAngleIntegral{f(\loc,\dirm)} \defined \frac{\sin(\Polar_p)}{V_i}\suml[k]\tA[mki]\segl\MOCTrackIntegral{f(\loc,\dirm)}
            \end{equation}
        }
        \subsection{Track-Length Renormalization}{\label{sec:MOC:Track-Length Renormalization}
            In general, the spatial integration described in \cref{ssec:MOC:Track-Based Integration} does not preserve the cell volume; this is visually apparent in \cref{fig:MOC:MOC Tracks}.
            In order to preserve spatial volumes within a cell, track-lengths are often ``renormalized''.
            There are three renormalization methods which become obvious through the notation presented in \cref{ssec:MOC:Track-Based Integration}:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item{segment-volume preservation}
                \item{angle-volume preservation}
                \item{volume preservation}
            \end{enumerate}

            Track-length renormalization involves adjusting the lengths of track-segments such that volume is preserved.
            Let us define a renormalization factor, $\renorm[mki]$, such that the renormalized track-length is given by
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Track-Length Renormalization}
                \nsegl = \renorm[mki]\segl.
            \end{equation}
            The spatial integration schemes given by \cref{eq:MOC:Track-Averaged Definition UnRenormalized,eq:MOC:Spatial Averaging Definition UnRenormalized} become
            \begin{subequations}\label{eq:MOC:Renormalized Spatial Integration Definition}
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Renormalized Track-Averaged Definition}
                    \MOCTrackIntegral{f(\loc,\dirm)} \defined \frac{1}{\nsegl}\intl[0][\nsegl]f(\len,\dirm)\dif{\nlen},
                \end{equation}
                and
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Renormalized Spatial Averaging Definition}
                    \MOCSingleAngleIntegral{f(\loc,\dirm)} \defined \frac{1}{V_i}\suml[k]\tA[mki]\nsegl\MOCTrackIntegral{f(\loc,\dirm)},
                \end{equation}
                where the spatial variable $\loc$ can now be written as a function of the renormalized track-distance, $\nlen$, as
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Renormalized Location Variable}
                    \loc =  \locIn + \nlen\dirm / \renorm[mki],
                \end{equation}
                where $\locIn$ is the starting point of the track-segment.
            \end{subequations}

            Segment-volume preservation is a renormalization method in which the track-length is adjusted such that the analytic volume within the cross-sectional area of each track-segment is preserved.
            This renormalization technique is the most ``correct'' method of renormalization, but is very expensive as each track is renormalized separately.
            It is also more difficult to implement, as the analytic area of each track-segment must be found.
            To the best of our knowledge, this method is not implemented in any production-level \ac{MOC} code.

            Angle-volume preservation is the next ``best'' renormalization technique.
            In this method, every mono-directional spatial integration should preserve the cell volume, i.e.
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Angle-Volume Preservation}
                \MOCSingleAngleIntegral{1} = 1.
            \end{equation}
            This constraint leads to the renormalization factor given by
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Direction-Dependent Renormalization}
                \renorm[mi] = \frac{V_i}{\suml[k]\tA[mki]\segl}.
            \end{equation}
            This method is significantly less expensive in terms of memory, computational time, and difficulty of implementation.

            The simplest renormalization technique, volume preservation, only preserves the volume over the spatial and directional integration, i.e.
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Volume Preservation}
                \MOCIntegral{1} = \fourpi.
            \end{equation}
            This constraint leads to the renormalization factor given by
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:Region Renormalization}
                \renorm[i] = \frac{V_i}{\suml[m]\wt[m]\suml[k]\tA[mki]\segl}.
            \end{equation}

            Renormalization is not the only technique used for volume preservation.
            Another method is to use the numerical volume, $\suml[k]\tA[mki]\segl$ in place of $V_i$ in \cref{eq:MOC:Spatial Averaging Definition UnRenormalized}.
            This seems to be a more consistent method; however, a detailed comparison of these methods has not taken place, to the best of my knowledge.
            The renormalization technique generally seems to be the faster approach, and is the approach used in MPACT \cite{Collins2016}, which is used extensively in this work.

    \section{The Flat-Source Approximation}{\label{sec:MOC:FSA}
        The simplest approximation to the spatial shape of the source, $\source[mi][g][\loc]$, within each cell is the \ac{FSA}.
        The \ac{MOC} has been widely used in lattice physics and neutron transport codes \cite{Knott2010}, many of which have utilized the \ac{FSMOC} \cite{Halsall1980,Hong1998,Saji2000,Smith2002,Sugimura2006,Masiello2008,Boyd2014,Collins2016}.

        \subsection{Derivation}{\label{ssec:MOC:FSA:Derivation}
            The \ac{FS} approximation is simply the assumption that within each cell, $\Region$, the source, $\source[mi][g][\loc]$, is uniform.
            This can be expressed as
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Source Shape}
                \source[mi][g][\loc] \approx \srcF[mi] = \srcF + \suml[\ell=0][L]\suml[n=-\ell][\ell]\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\srcF[i,\ell][g,n]
            \end{equation}
            Thus, to get a source in this form, \cref{eq:MOC:Source} requires, that the region averaged scalar flux and higher-order angular moments (up to order $L$) be determined.
            In mathematical terms, the flat-source can be determined as
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Source Computation}
                \srcF[mi] =
                    \left[
                        \suml[\gprime]\suml[\ell=0][L]\suml[n=-\ell][\ell]\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\xss[\ell]\afluxmom[\gprime]
                        + \frac{\spect}{\keff}\suml[\gprime]\nufis\sflux[\gprime]
                    \right],
            \end{equation}
            where the $\sflux[\gprime]$ is the region-averaged scalar flux, and $\afluxmom[\gprime]$ are the region-averaged higher-order angular moments of the flux.

            In order to get these region-averaged flux moments, the spatial and directional integration operators, introduced in \cref{ssec:MOC:Track-Based Integration}, are used.
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:FSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moments Definition}
                The region-averaged scalar flux is then given by
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Region-Averaged Scalar Flux Definition}
                    \sflux = \MOCIntegral{\aflux[][g][]} = \frac{\fourpi}{V_i}\suml[m]\wt[m]\suml[k]\nsegl\tA[mki]\MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]},
                \end{equation}
                and the higher-order angular moments of the flux are given by
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Region-Averaged Angular Moments of Flux Definition}
                    \afluxmom[g] = \MOCIntegral{\SH\aflux[][g][]} = \frac{\fourpi}{V_i}\suml[m]\wt[m]\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\suml[k]\nsegl\tA[mki]\MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]}.
                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}

            To evaluate these flux moments, the track-averaged angular flux, $\MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]}$, must be found.
            By applying the \ac{FSA}, \cref{eq:MOC:MOC Equation Generic} becomes
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Characteristic Form}
                \left[\deriv{}{\nlen} + \xst\right]\aflux[mki][g][\nlen] = \tsrcF[mi],
            \end{equation}
            where
            \begin{equation}
              \label{eq:MOC:FSA:Track Average Source}
              \tsrcF[mi] \defined \rfourpi\srcF[mi].
            \end{equation}
            This can be solved analytically for the angular flux along the track,
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:FSA:Angular Flux Solution}
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Angular Flux Solution}
                    \aflux[mki][g][\nlen] = \afluxin + \left(\frac{\tsrcF[mi]}{\xst} - \afluxin\right)F_1(\opt),
                \end{equation}
                where
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:F1}
                    F_1(\opt) \defined 1 - \exp(-\opt),
                \end{equation}
                and $\opt$ is the (renormalized) optical thickness,
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Optical Thickness}
                    \opt \defined \nlen\xst.
                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}

            One approach to find $\MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]}$, is to plug \cref{eq:MOC:FSA:Angular Flux Solution} to explicitly evaluate the track-average value, resulting in
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Track-Averaged Angular Flux Explicit}
                \MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]} = \frac{\tsrcF[mi]}{\xst} - \left(\frac{\tsrcF[mi]}{\xst} - \afluxin\right)\frac{F_1(\segopt)}{\segopt}.
            \end{equation}
            Another, approach, which in the author's opinion is simpler, is use the track-averaging operator on the characteristic form of the equation, \cref{eq:MOC:FSA:Characteristic Form}, which then simplifies to
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Track-Averaged Angular Flux Implicit}
                \MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]} = \frac{\tsrcF[mi]}{\xst} + \frac{\afluxin-\afluxout}{\segopt}.
            \end{equation}
            Note, that these two forms are equivalent; by evaluating the outgoing flux in \cref{eq:MOC:FSA:Angular Flux Solution} at the outgoing position, \cref{eq:MOC:FSA:Track-Averaged Angular Flux Implicit} can be put into the form of \cref{eq:MOC:FSA:Track-Averaged Angular Flux Explicit}.
            The track-averaged angular flux can be used in \cref{eqs:MOC:FSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moments Definition} to evaluate the flux moments, which can then be used to compute the source.
            A transport calculation can then be carried out using the source iteration algorithm defined by \cref{alg:NTT:Source Iteration}.
        }
        \subsection{Particle Conservation}{\label{ssec:MOC:FSA:Particle Conservation}
            The neutron transport equation, \cref{eq:NTT:Boltzmann Transport}, is a statement of particle balance within the defined phase-space.
            Previous works \cite{LeTellier2008,Ferrer2018} have examined the \ac{FSMOC} with respect to \emph{particle conservation}.
            \citet{LeTellier2008} defined necessary constraints on the directional quadrature and the characteristic tracks (trajectories) in order to ensure particle conservation for the anisotropic \ac{FSMOC}.
            The constraints can be found by requiring
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Anisotropic Source Conservation}

            \end{equation}
            Substituting \cref{eq:MOC:FSA:Source Shape} into \cref{eq:MOC:FSA:Anisotropic Source Conservation}, requires that
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:FSA:Anisotropic Constraints}
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Quadrature Constraint}
                    \suml[m]\wt[m]\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\SH[\ell'][n'][\dirm] = \delta_{\ell\ell'}\delta_{nn'},
                \end{equation}
                and
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Track Constraint}
                    \suml[k]\nsegl\tA[mki] = V_i.
                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}
            \Cref{eq:MOC:FSA:Quadrature Constraint} is a constraint on the directional quadrature, requiring orthogonality of the real spherical harmonics \cite{LeTellier2008}.
            \Cref{eq:MOC:FSA:Track Constraint} requires that direction-dependent renormalization, \cref{eq:MOC:Direction-Dependent Renormalization}, is used.

            If the constraints on directional quadrature, and characteristic tracks, are satisfied several simplifications to \cref{eqs:MOC:FSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moments Definition} can be made.
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:FSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moments}
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Region-Averaged Scalar Flux}
                    \sflux = \frac{\srcF}{\xst} + \frac{\fourpi}{V_i\xst}\suml[m]\wt[m]\suml[k]\tA[mki]\dflux,

                \end{equation}
                where

                    \dflux \defined \afluxin - \afluxout.
                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}
        }
        \subsection{Isotropic Simplifications}{\label{ssec:MOC:FSA:Isotropic Simplifications}
            While anisotropic scattering is necessary for accurate calculations, it is also common for isotropic source calculations to be performed.
            Typically, these account for anisotropic behavior by using the \ac{TCP0} approximation \cite{YamamotoAnisotropy2008}.
            While not as accurate as truly anisotropic calculations, use of an isotropic source results in significantly fewer calculations, and allows for additional simplifications to be made.

            \Cref{eq:MOC:FSA:Anisotropic Source Conservation} is now only of concern for the isotropic component of the source.
            This results in the following constraint,
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:FSA:Isotropic Track Constraint}
                \suml[m]\wt[m]\suml[k]\nsegl\tA[mki] = V_i,
            \end{equation}
            which is equivalent to the direction-independent renormalization, given by \cref{eq:MOC:Region Renormalization}.
        }
        \subsection{Applications}{\label{ssec:FSA:Applications}
            The \ac{FSMOC} has been utilized in many \ac{MOC} production codes \cite{Halsall1980,Hong1998,Saji2000,Smith2002,Sugimura2006,Masiello2008,Boyd2014,Collins2016}.
            However, previous studies on the \ac{FSMOC} have found that a fine mesh must be used to obtain accurate results, particularly in the presence of control rods or blades, strong absorber rods, gadolinia poisoned fuel rods \cite{Petkov1999}, as well as in the presence of large reflector regions (such as in critical experiments) \cite{Ferrer2016}.
            As the number of mesh elements increase, so does the number of track-segments (on which the \ac{MOC} computations are performed), which may result in large run-times.
            This has motivated the development of \acp{LSA} to the \ac{MOC}, which are discussed in detail in \cref{sec:MOC:LSA}.
        }
    }
    \section{The Linear-Source Approximation}{\label{sec:MOC:LSA}
        \subsection{Overview}{\label{ssec:MOC:LSA:Overview}
            The \acf{LSA}, in the \ac{MOC}, assumes the shape of the source along a characteristic track-segment is linear.
            There has long been motivation for the development of \acp{LSA} for the \ac{MOC}, as previous work \cite{Larsen1980} indicated that a spatially linear source was able to achieve faster computational performance in \ac{SN} calculations.
            There have been many different variants of this approximation.
            The first instance of the \ac{LSA} was the \emph{gradient source approximation} introduced by \citet{Halsall1993}.
            This early \ac{LSMOC} was based on the averaging of the angular flux gradient along tracks, and was implemented in the WIMS \cite{Halsall1993}, and PEACH \cite{Tang2009} \ac{MOC} transport codes.
            These averaged gradients were then used as estimates to the gradient of the scalar flux, which were used to compute the source shape as spatially linear.

            \citeauthor{Petkov1998} devised a \ac{LSA} that estimated the gradient of the scalar flux based on the $P_1$ approximation in the MARIKO code \cite{Petkov1998,Petkov1999}.
            In this approximation, the gradient of the scalar flux is computed from the neutron current, the total cross section, and the linearly anisotropic scattering matrix:
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Current2Gradient}
                \grad\sflux \approx -3\left(\xst\current - \suml[\gprime]\xss[1]\current[i][\gprime]\right).
            \end{equation}
            A similar approach, using the diffusion approximation to compute the scalar flux gradient, was used in the so called ``quasi-linear'' source implemented by \citet{Rabiti2009}.
            In this approach, the $\xss[1]$ matrix is diagonalized, turning the $P_1$ approximation into the diffusion approximation.
            Due to their basis on the $P_1$ and diffusion approximations, these early \acp{LSA} are inaccurate in situations where more transport-like effects are present.
            It can be shown, even in simple cases, that this approximation can be predict the opposite direction for the scalar flux gradient.
            % NOTE[show TCP0 work here?]

            \citet{Santandrea2002} introduced the positive linear and nonlinear surface characteristics scheme, which constructed a linear source by interpolating between source values on the surfaces of cell regions.
            Various improvements have been made to this surface characteristics scheme for conservation \cite{Santandrea2002}, as well as coupling in APOLLO2 \cite{Santandrea2008}.
            \citet{LeTellier2006} introduced a simplification to the linear characteristics scheme for conservation, by using a diamond-differencing scheme.
            This work was extended by \citet{Hebert2016}, to include higher-order diamond difference schemes, as well as allowing for acceleration \cite{Hebert2017}.

            The most recent \ac{LSA} examined in this work was introduced as a 2-D general high-order method for unstructured meshes by \citet{Masiello2009}.
            The approximation uses track-based integration, defined in \cref{ssec:MOC:Track-Based Integration}, in order to compute spatial moments of the angular flux.
            This \ac{LSA} was shown to reduce memory and computation times in 3-D \ac{MOC} calculations \cite{Chai2009}.
            The general method was simplified in the case of the isotropic and anisotropic \ac{LS} by \citet{Ferrer2016}; this also introduced the ``LS-P0'' method in which the isotropic source is spatially linear, but the anisotropic source components are spatially uniform within each cell.
            This \ac{LSA} was also to be consistent with particle conservation, under certain constraints, and shown to be compatible with \ac{CMFD} acceleration \cite{Ferrer2018}.

            As part of this thesis work, significant effort has been spent on improvements to this moment-based \ac{LSA} in problems with near-void regions \cite{Fitzgerald2018}, and for the multi-physics problems that are of interest in the \ac{CASL} program \cite{Fitzgerald2019}.
            While this method is capable of modeling general spatially linear anisotropic source, previous work has shown that treating only the isotropic source as spatially linear is more practical \cite{Ferrer2016}; thus, the derivation provided in the next section is for such a source.
        }
        \subsection{Derivation}{\label{ssec:MOC:LSA:Derivation}
            The moment-based \ac{LSA} assumes the shape of the source, $\source[mi][g][\loc]$, is spatially linear within each cell, $\Region$.
            This can be expressed as
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:LSA:Source Shape}
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Source Shape}
                    \source[mi][g][\loc] \approx \srcF[mi] + \loc\vdot\srcL,
                \end{equation}
                where $\srcL$ is a column vector of source spatial expansion coefficients,
                \begin{equation}
                    \srcL \defined\begin{bmatrix}\srcL[x]\\\srcL[y]\\\srcL[z]\end{bmatrix},
                \end{equation}
                and $\loc$ is the position in \emph{local} coordinates.
            \end{subequations}
            A similar spatial expansion of the angular moments of the flux can be performed,
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Flux Expansion}
                \fluxA(\loc) = \fluxF + \loc\vdot\fluxL,
            \end{equation}
            the source can then be expressed as
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Linear Source Computation}
                \source[mi][g][\loc]
                    = \suml[\gprime]\suml[\ell=0][L]\suml[n=-\ell][\ell]\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\xss[\ell]\fluxA[\gprime](\loc)
                    + \frac{\spect}{\keff}\suml[\gprime]\nufis\sflux[\gprime](\loc),
            \end{equation}
            and the linear expansion coefficients are explicitly given by
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Linear Source Coefficients}
                \srcL
                    = \suml[\gprime]\suml[\ell=0][L]\suml[n=-\ell][\ell]\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\xss[\ell]\fluxL[\gprime]
                    + \frac{\spect}{\keff}\suml[\gprime]\nufis\sfluxL[\gprime].
            \end{equation}

            In the spatial moment-base \ac{LSA}, it is convenient to define the spatially linear source (and flux) in terms of a cell-local coordinate system.
            Allow $\Loc$ to be the position variable in the global coordinate system, the local coordinates are then defined as
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Global to Local Coordinates}
                \loc = \Loc - \centroid[\Loc][mi],
            \end{equation}
            where $\centroid[\Loc][mi]$ is the numerical centroid of the cell $i$.

            These numerical centroids can be defined as either direction-dependent, or direction-independent, which will have implications on particle conservation, as discussed in \cref{ssec:MOC:LSA:Particle Conservation}.
            The direction-dependent centroids are defined by
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Direction-Dependent Centroids}
                \centroid[\Loc][mi] \defined \MOCSingleAngleIntegral{\Loc} = \frac{1}{V_i}\suml[k]\tA[mki]\nsegl\locCent[\Loc],
            \end{equation}
            where $\locCent[\Loc]$ is the global coordinate vector of the track-segment mid-point.
            Similarly, the direction-independent centroids are defined by
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Direction-Independent Centroids}
                \centroid[\Loc][i] \defined \rfourpi\MOCIntegral{\Loc} = \frac{1}{V_i}\suml[m]\wt\suml[k]\tA[mki]\nsegl\locCent[\Loc].
            \end{equation}

            Following the same approach as the \ac{FSMOC} derivation, in \cref{ssec:MOC:FSA:Derivation}, computing the source the region-averaged flux moment, $\fluxF$, and the flux expansion coefficients, $\fluxL$, are required.
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moments Definitions}
                The region-averaged flux moment can be found using the same definition as previously,
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moment Definition}
                    \fluxF \defined \MOCIntegral{\SH \aflux[][g][]} = \frac{\fourpi}{V_i}\suml[m]\wt\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\suml[k]\tA[mki]\nsegl\MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]}.
                \end{equation}
                In order to determine the spatial expansion coefficients of the flux moments, \cref{eq:MOC:LSA:Flux Expansion} is operated on by $\MOCIntegral{\SH(\vdot)\loc^T}$.
                Recognizing that this should be directly proportional to angular flux operated on by $\MOCIntegral{\SH\aflux[][g][]\loc^T}$, a system of equations is found
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Moment to Expansion Coefficient}
                    \M\fluxL = \MOCIntegral{\SH\loc\aflux[][g][]},
                \end{equation}
                where
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Geometric Moments}
                    \M \defined \MOCIntegral{\loc^T\loc}.
                \end{equation}
                The spatial angular flux moments, $\MOCIntegral{\SH\loc\aflux[][g][]}$, are then defined as
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Revion-Averaged Spatial Angular Flux Moments Definition}
                    \MOCIntegral{\SH\loc\aflux[][g][]} = \frac{\fourpi}{V_i}\suml[m]\wt\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\suml[k]\tA[mki]\nsegl\left(\locIn\MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]} + \dirm\MOCTrackIntegral{\nlen\aflux[][g][]} / \renorm[mi]\right).
                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}

            In order to evaluate the flux moments defined in \cref{eqs:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moments Definitions}, the track-averaged angular flux values, $\MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]}$, and $\MOCTrackIntegral{\nlen\aflux[][g][]}$, must be determined.
            First, the transport equation must be put into characteristic form, using \cref{eq:MOC:Renormalized Location Variable} the spatially expanded source, \cref{eq:MOC:LSA:Source Shape}, can be defined along the characteristic.
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:LSA:Characteristic Form}
                The characteristic transport equation becomes
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Characteristic Form}
                    \left[\deriv{}{\nlen} + \xst\right]\aflux = \tsrcF + \tsrcL\left(\nlen - \frac{\nsegl}{2}\right),
                \end{equation}
                where
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Track Average Source}
                    \tsrcF \defined \rfourpi\left[\srcF[mi] + \locCent \vdot \srcL\right],
                \end{equation}
                and
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Track Linear Source}
                    \tsrcL \defined \rfourpi\left[\frac{\dirm\vdot\srcL}{\renorm[mi]}\right].
                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}
            This can be solved analytically for the angular flux along the track,
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:LSA:Angular Flux Solution}
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Angular Flux Solution}
                    \aflux = \afluxin + \left(\frac{\tsrcF}{\xst} - \afluxin\right)F_1(\opt) + \frac{\tsrcL}{2(\xst)^2}F_2(\opt),
                \end{equation}
                where
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:F1}
                    F_1(\opt) \defined 1 - \exp(-\opt),
                \end{equation}
                and
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:F2}
                    F_2(\opt) \defined 2[\opt-F_1(\opt)] - \segopt F_1(\opt).
                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}

            As discussed in \cref{ssec:MOC:FSA:Derivation}, there are two \emph{equivalent} methods with which one could determine the track-averaged angular flux values.
            However, it is the author's opinion that defining these moments implicitly, by taking the moments of the characteristic equation (\cref{eq:MOC:LSA:Characteristic Form}), results in a form that is simpler.
            The original basis of this work \cite{Ferrer2016}, evaluated the linear moment explicitly; for brevity, the derivation will only be shown here with the implicitly defined moment.
            Previous work \cite{Fitzgerald2019} has also shown that by using the form given by the implicit definition, there are significant benefits in multi-physics applications.
            The implicitly defined moments, given by operating on \cref{eq:MOC:LSA:Characteristic Form} by $\MOCTrackIntegral{(\vdot)}$ and $\MOCTrackIntegral{\nlen(\vdot)}$, are given by
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:LSA:Track-Averaged Moments}
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Track-Averaged Angular Flux}
                    \MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]} = \frac{\tsrcF}{\xst} + \frac{\dflux}{\segopt},
                \end{equation}
                and
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Track-Averaged Linear Angular Flux}
                    \MOCTrackIntegral{\nlen\aflux[][g][]} = \frac{\MOCTrackIntegral{\aflux[][g][]} - \afluxout}{\xst} + \frac{\nsegl}{2}\left[\frac{\tsrcF}{\xst} + \frac{\tsrcL}{\xst}\frac{\nsegl}{6}\right].
                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}
            Due to the presence of the $\dflux/\segopt$ term in \cref{eq:MOC:LSA:Track-Averaged Linear Angular Flux}, it is beneficial to stability and performance \cite{Fitzgerald2018,Fitzgerald2019} to compute this quantity directly, rather than computing $\dflux$ (as is done for \ac{FSMOC}).
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:LSA:Delta Flux over Optical Thickness}
                This can be found explicitly by subtracting \cref{eq:MOC:LSA:Angular Flux Solution} evaluated at the exiting location from $\afluxin$ and dividing by $\segopt$, to get
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Delta Flux over Optical Thickness}
                    \frac{\dflux}{\segopt} = \left(\afluxin-\frac{\tsrcF}{\xst}\right)E_1(\segopt) - \frac{\nsegl}{2}\frac{\tsrcL}{\xst}T_2(\segopt),
                \end{equation}
                where
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:E1}
                    E_1(\segopt) \defined \frac{F_1(\segopt)}{\segopt},
                \end{equation}
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:T2}
                    T_2(\segopt) \defined 2E_2(\segopt) - E_1(\segopt),
                \end{equation}
                and
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:E2}
                    E_2(\segopt) \defined \frac{1-E_1(\segopt)}{\segopt}.
                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}
        }
        \subsection{Particle Conservation}{\label{ssec:MOC:LSA:Particle Conservation}
            In consideration to particle balance, use of the \ac{LSA} results in additional constraints on the calculations.
            Similarly to \cref{ssec:MOC:FSA:Particle Conservation}, the track-based integration of the source must exactly integrate to the spatial and angular moments of the source.
            The conservation of spatial moments is the basis of this \ac{LSA} \cite{Ferrer2018}, so this constraint is satisfied without additional constraints on the method.
            The angular moment constraint is expressed as
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Angular Moment Constaint}
                \rfourpi\MOCIntegral{\SH\source[mi][g][\loc]} = \srcF[i,\ell][g,n].
            \end{equation}
            In addition to the constraints introduced in \cref{ssec:MOC:FSA:Particle Conservation}, namely direction-dependent renormalization, and directional quadrature restrictions, this places constraints on the definition of the local coordinate system:
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Anisotropic Coordinate Constraint}
                \MOCSingleAngleIntegral{\loc} = 0.
            \end{equation}
            This is equivalent to stating that the local coordinate system must be defined with respect to direction-dependent global centroids, as is given by \cref{eq:MOC:LSA:Direction-Dependent Centroids}.

            If these constraints are satisfied, \cref{eqs:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moments Definitions} can be simplified,
            \begin{subequations}\label{eqs:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Flux Moments}
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Scalar Flux}
                    \sflux = \frac{\srcF}{\xst} + \frac{\fourpi}{V_i\xst}\suml[m]\wt[m]\suml[k]\tA[mki]\dflux,
                \end{equation}
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Angular Moments of Flux}
                    \fluxF = \frac{\tsrcF[i,\ell][g,n]}{\xst} + \frac{\fourpi}{V_i\xst}\suml[m]\wt[m]\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\suml[k]\tA[mki]\dflux,
                \end{equation}
                and
                \begin{aequation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Spatial Moments of Flux}
                    \MOCIntegral{\loc\SH\aflux[][g][]}
                        &= \suml[m]\wt\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\M[][mi]\frac{\srcL[][mi]}{\xst}\\
                        &+ \frac{\fourpi}{V_i\xst}\suml[m]\wt\SH[\ell][n][\dirm]\suml[k]
                            \tA\left[\locIn\dflux + \dirm\segl\left(\frac{\dflux}{\segopt}-\afluxout + \frac{\tsrcF}{\xst}\right)\right]
                \end{aequation}
                where
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Delta Flux}
                    \dflux \defined \afluxin - \afluxout,
                \end{equation}
                and
                \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Direction Dependent M}
                  \M[][mi] \defined \MOCSingleAngleIntegral{\loc^T\loc}.
                \end{equation}
            \end{subequations}
        }
        \subsection{Spatial and Isotropic Simplifications}{\label{ssec:MOC:LSA:Isotropic Simplifications}
            The work introducing the original formulation of the moment-based \ac{LSA} suggests that it is beneficial to allow only the isotropic moments of the source and flux to be spatially linear, while higher order moments are spatially flat.
            The reformulation introduced as part of this work \cite{Fitzgerald2019} was extended to make this simplification in the so called \acf{LIFA} source [CITATION].
            The linear moment equations can then be simplified to
            \begin{aequation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:LIFA Region-Averaged Spatial Moments of Flux}
                \MOCIntegral{\loc\aflux[][g][]}
                    &= \M\frac{\srcL}{\xst}
                    + \frac{\fourpi}{V_i\xst}\suml[m]\wt\suml[k]
                        \tA\left[\locIn\dflux + \dirm\segl\left(\frac{\dflux}{\segopt} - \afluxout + \frac{\tsrcF}{\xst}\right)\right].
            \end{aequation}

            In the case of an isotropic source, the constraints for particle balance are relaxed.
            Track-length renormalization as well as numerical centroid definitions can be direction-independent while still preserving particle conservation \cite{Ferrer2018}, as given by \cref{eq:MOC:Region Renormalization}, and \cref{eq:MOC:LSA:Direction-Independent Centroids} respectively.
            The calculation of angular flux spatial moments, given in \cref{eq:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Spatial Moments of Flux}, can also be simplified into the form
            \begin{equation}\label{eq:MOC:LSA:Region-Averaged Spatial Moments of Flux Isotropic}
                \MOCIntegral{\loc\aflux[][g][]}
                        = \M\frac{\srcL}{\xst}
                        + \frac{\fourpi}{V_i\xst}\suml[m]\wt\suml[k]\tA
                            \left(\dirm\segl\left[\frac{\dflux}{\segopt} - \afluxout\right]+ \locIn\dflux\right).
            \end{equation}
        }
        \subsection{Applications}{\label{ssec:MOC:LSA:Applications}
            Various different \acp{LSA} to the \ac{MOC} have been developed and implemented in transport codes \cite{Halsall1993,Petkov1999,Santandrea2002,Tang2009,Rabiti2009,Boyd2014,Ferrer2016,Fitzgerald2018}.
            Result have indicated that by using a \ac{LSA}, the spatial mesh discretization can be made coarser, relative to with a \ac{FSA}, while maintaining accuracy.
            Although each segment calculation is more expensive when using a \ac{LSA}, the number of calculations (due to the coarser spatial mesh) can be significantly reduced, leading to reduced run-times.
            Additionally, the reduction in spatial mesh elements generally reduces the amount of memory used by the calculation.
            As part of this work, a spatial mesh discretization study was performed on problems with multi-physics applications in mind \cite{Fitzgerald2019}; this is presented in more detail in \cref{sec:Results:2-D Linear Source}.

    \section{Parallelism}{\label{sec:MOC:Parallelism}
        High-fidelity transport methods, such as the \ac{MOC}, can require significant computational resources for full core calculations; this is particularly true for 3-D calculations.
        While processing power has increased exponentially since the \ac{MOC} was first conceived in 1972 \cite{Askew1972}, since the early 2000's, single-core processing power has largely leveled off.
        System architectures, as well as code design, have become more focused on \emph{parallel} computations.
        Previous works \cite{Kochunas2013} made significant progress in the efficient parallelization of the \ac{MOC}.

        \citet{Kochunas2013} developed a hybrid-parallel algorithm for the \ac{MOC} that included thread-based parallelism over characteristic tracks, as well as spatial and angular decomposition.
        This work showed that the \ac{MOC} was able to scale well up to 10000's of processors.
        While this work is important, and has led to significant advancement, the use of 1000's of processors is not feasible for industrial use.
        It is thus the author's opinion that the primary focus of research on 3-D \ac{MOC} techniques should be on serial efficiency, such as the \acf{LS} (\cref{sec:MOC:LSA}), and macroray (\cref{ssec:RT:Macroray});
        however, moderate levels of parallelism are feasible for industry, and so more efficient parallelism should also be a focus of research.

        In \ac{MOC} calculations, each characteristic track calculation is nearly independent from others; previous works have indicated that loops over characteristic tracks can be parallelized efficiently by using threads on traditional \acp{CPU} \cite{Kochunas2013} or on \acp{GPGPU} \cite{Boyd2014}.
        This type of parallelism is most generally called \emph{shared-data parallelism}, as data is shared between the parallel threads.

        Large neutronics calculations may require significant amounts of memory, and thus \emph{distributed-data parallelism} is necessary.
        In general, this type of parallelism separates (partitions) a domain of the problem, and separate computing nodes are assigned a subdomain.
        Only data for the assigned subdomain is stored, and thus whole-core simulations become possible; additionally, because each subdomain can be processed in parallel, overall runtimes typically decrease with increasing numbers of subdomains (processors).

        MPACT has the capabilities for domain decomposition/parallelism over two separate domains: space and direction.
        In MPACT, each discrete direction has an easily calculable amount of work, and the decomposition is trivial; in general the same cannot be said of the spatial domain.
        As part of this thesis work, a more efficient method of spatial decomposition has been investigated and developed in MPACT \cite{Fitzgerald2019a}.
        A journal article on this work has been submitted to the Annals of Nuclear Energy; for now, the submitted manuscript is attached in \cref{ch:Spatial Decomposition in MPACT}.
