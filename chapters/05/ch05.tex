  \label{ch:Improved Linear Source Formulation for Multi-physics and 2D/1D Applications}
  The studies performed in this thesis have made extensive use of the \acf{LSA} introduced by \citet{Ferrer2016}.
  Through the use of the approximation, as presented in the original work, instabilities and inefficiencies were found.
  This chapter aims to present two improvements made to this approximation that have been a focus of this research: improved exponential tabulation, and an improved formulation for multi-physics and 2D/1D applications.
