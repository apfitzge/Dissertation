    \subsection{Summary: Spatial Decomposition}{\label{ssec:Summary:Spatial Decomposition}
      Prior to this work, MPACT \cite{MPACT2016} use an automated spatial decomposition method based on the fuel assemblies.
      This method was limited, and only allowed for specific numbers of spatial domains to be used.
      Additionally, such methods have been shown, in other codes, to result in very poor load balance, particularly when a large coarsely meshed radial reflector is present \cite{Gunow2018}.
      Stimpson \cite{StimpsonPartitioning2017} improved MPACT's parallel capabilities, allowing for a problem to be decomposed into groups of ray-tracing modules.
      However, that work did not introduce a method for generating better spatial decompositions, and relied on the user to enter a decomposition map.
      This was tedious for the user, and ofter resulted in non-optimal decompositions.

      This dissertation's work on spatial decomposition sought to develop decomposition methods to
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item{improve load-balance,}
        \item{improve user experience (no additional work),}
        \item{and, allow for less restrictions on the number of domains.}
      \end{enumerate}
      These improvements can be made by utilizing graph partitioning methods, which have been highly studied in computer science \cite{Elsner1997}.
      Software libraries exist for performing graph partitioning (METIS \cite{METIS}, Zoltan \cite{Boman2012}, etc.).
      However, due to MPACT's strict requirements on the decomposition (see \cref{sec:Spatial Decomposition:Spatial Decomposition in MPACT}), these libraries could not easily be used in MPACT.
      Several graph partitioning methods were implemented in MPACT.
      For unweighted graphs, and not conforming to MPACT's restrictions, these method were shown to be comparable to METIS \cite{Fitzgerald2017}.

      The methods were then applied to MPACT and made to conform with the restrictions MPACT places on its' spatial decomposition \cite{Fitzgerald2019a}.
      This work introduced a new graph partitioning method based on the recursive expansion methods, and an improvement to the Kernighan-Lin \cite{Kernighan1970} algorithm for the application to \ac{MOC}.
      These new methods, as well as the \acf{RSB} and \acf{RIB} were used to decompose a 2-D transport problem and resource comparisons of the simulations were compared.
      In 3-D several different decomposition approaches were investigated, and a 3-D core was decomposed.
      For the 3-D calculations, only metrics of the decomposition were compared, rather than actual simulation results.

    \subsection{Summary: Linear Source}{\label{ssec:Summary:Linear Source}
      In the past, \acf{MOC} codes have used the \acf{FSA}, but more recently codes have been using the \acf{LSA} \cite{Halsall1993,Petkov1999,Santandrea2002,Tang2009,Rabiti2009,Hebert2016,Ferrer2016,Gunow2018}.
      The general goal of these \acp{LSA} is to coarsen the computational mesh, leading to overall improved run-times.
      However, many of these previous \acp{LSA} have been \emph{ad-hoc}.
      Several of these methods \cite{Santandrea2002,Hebert2016,Ferrer2016} have been based on particle conservation.
      The \ac{LSA} developed by \citet{Ferrer2016} was implemented into the MPACT code \cite{Fitzgerald2018,Fitzgerald2019}.

      Once implemented in MPACT, the \ac{LSA} was tested on several problems, and two flaws were observed.
      The first was an implementation detail; typically, exponential functions in the \ac{MOC} are approximated so reduce run-time \cite{Yamamoto2004}.
      However, when the exponential functions in the \ac{LSA} were approximated in problems with near-void regions, such as the fuel-clad gap, iterative instability was observed.
      Different methods for addressing this instability were studied in this work \cite{Fitzgerald2018}.

      The second flaw, was that for problems with multiple physics (\acf{TH} feedback, or isotropic depletion) or in the 2D/1D approximation \cite{Collins2016}, the method was far less efficient.
      This was due to the changing macroscopic cross sections, which led to coefficients needing to be recalculated every state-point, or even every iteration.
      This work sought to eliminate the need to recompute these coefficients by eliminating their dependence on the cross section \cite{Fitzgerald2019}.
      The elimination of the group-dependent coefficients in the \ac{LSA} was achieved by re-formulating the method \cref{ch:Improved Linear Source Formulation for Multi-physics and 2D/1D Applications}.

    \subsection{Summary: MacroRay}{\label{ssec:Summary:MacroRay}
      Three-dimensional \ac{MOC} calculations are generally considered to be too expensive for use in realistic calculations; the methods rarely see use outside academia or national laboratories.
      The primary factor in determining \ac{MOC} run-time is the number of track segments.
      By using a coarser ray-spacing, far fewer track-segments are generated and can significantly improve run-time (\cref{sec:Improved Linear Source Formulation for Multi-physics and 2D/1D Applications}).
      However, the presence of small strong absorber regions anywhere in a problem can prevent the use of coarser rays.
      This motivates the use of a ray-tracing method which is able to use different effective ray-spacings in regions with different requirements.

      The macroband \cite{Villarino1992,Petkov1999,Yamamoto2005,Fevotte2007} is a ray-tracing method which bases the placement of rays on the computational mesh of the problem.
      This method forces the use of finer ray-spacing where small regions are present, and allows for coarser ray-spacing where there are not small regions.
      With the use of non-uniform ray-spacing \cite{Yamamoto2005}, these methods can reduce the number of rays necessary for accurate integration.
      However, the method is not compatible with \acf{DNPL}, meaning that an approximation of the angular flux at interfaces is necessary, unlike the traditional \acf{MRT} ray-tracing methods.

      While the macroband has been previously studied for 2-D \ac{MOC}, there has been no extension or investigation of the method for 3-D \ac{MOC} calculations.
      This dissertation seeks to fill that gap, and provides one possible extension of the macroband to 3-D problems.
      This extension, the macroray ray-tracing method, was implemented in a library dependent on MPACT, and tested on several 3-D transport problems.
      The method was compared against the traditional \ac{MRT} ray-tracing method, with a particular focus on accuracy versus the number of track-segments.

    }


    1. Spatial Decomposition
      - Greatly improved user experience:
        * Able to use any number of radial domains (must be same for each level in 2D/1D)
        * Automatic
        * Improves load-balance compared with manual decompositions
      - Load-balance greatly improved over current methods
      - Iterative efficiency decreased due to ``jagged'' domains (re-entrant rays)
      - CMFD solvers need to be improved...for large cases this becomes significantly more expensive than transport
        * Other groups have not seen this
    2. Linear Source
      - Exponentials:
        * Instability no longer observed for problems with near-void regions
        * Exponential and MOC run-times improved
      - Improved Formulation:
        * IMO: A more elegant form
        * Same number of operations (assuming FMA instructions are available)
        * Run-times improved by 10-15\% in multiphysics cases (T/H feedback)
    3. MacroRay
      - Uniform convergence behavior is nice
      - Much more of a ``black-box'' solver (I don't really need to know what my problem looks like)
      - Implementation is (unfortunately) inefficient:
        * However, this method has NOT had years of optimization like the MRT
        * Particularly bad in MPI communication (What\%):
          - Can be improved:
            * Fewer wait alls
            * Collected communication
        * Interface flux:
          - Setting/getting flux to/from the interfaces takes up a large chunk of time (What\%)
        * Actual transport is quite fast (What\%)
        * Number of segments improved for accurate result?
      - Compared to MIT still not great.
