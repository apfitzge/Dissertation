abstract = {A Linear Source (LS) approximation has been implemented in the two-dimensional Method of Characteristics (MOC) transport solver in a prototype version of CASMO5. The LS approximation, which relies on the computation of trajectory-based spatial moments over source regions to obtain the linear source expansion coefficients, improves the solution accuracy relative to the „flat‟ or constant source approximation. In addition, the LS formulation is capable of treating arbitrarily-shaped source regions and is compatible with standard Coarse-Mesh Finite Difference (CMFD) acceleration. Numerical tests presented in this paper for the C5G7 MOX benchmark show that, for comparable accuracy with respect to the reference solution, the LS approximation can reduce the run time by a factor of four and the memory requirements by a factor of ten relative to the FS scheme.},

The implementation, which is part of a new development called The Advanced Random Ray Code (ARRC), is one of the first parallel implementations of TRRM. Our goal is to better understand the accuracy and performance characteristics of TRRM on massive scale problems, and to provide community software that facilitates further algorithmic development and potentially its application to a broader class of problems. Key features of ARRC include extreme memory efficiency, domain decomposition, a task based parallel structure, and the ability to efficiently utilize Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) vector units. These attributes lead to efficient performance on modern high performance computer (HPC) architectures, enabling the detailed simulation of reactor cores in three dimensions.},

Unfortunately, none of these methods is able to maximize the profit of vectorization and at the same time, provide sufficient accuracy. Indeed, many applications such as solving PDEs, simulations of neuronal networks, Fourier transforms and many more involved a large quantity of exponentials that have to be computed efficiently. In this paper we device and demonstrate the usefulness of a novel formulation to compute the exponential employing only floating point operations, with a flexible accuracy ranging from a few digits up to the full machine precision. Using the presented algorithm we can compute exponentials of large vectors, in any application setting, maximizing the performance gains of the vectorization units available to modern processors. This immediately results in a speedup for all applications.},

@article{Rabiti2009,
abstract = {The Method Of Characteristics (MOC) has been widely used for two dimensional lattice calculations. One of the main drawbacks of the MOC is its poor spatial representation of the within-group energy source, which requires the use of a very fine mesh to adequately resolve the neutron flux solution. The most straightforward way to improve the spatial representation of this source would be to project the scalar flux to a set of higher-order trial functions within each mesh element, but this is expensive. An alternative to this has already been proposed that exploits the angular flux moments on the surfaces of each mesh element. In this paper, we present a new alternative in which we define a higher order representation of the isotropic source. The key feature of our method is the introduction of a new, linear discontinuous source representation that does not resort to an expensive spatial projection. This is accomplished by using a P1 approximation to construct the average derivative of the spatial source. So far, the derivation has been done only for a linear representation of the isotropic sources in two and three-dimensional geometries. The paper presents an analysis of the performance of the new method in simple cases and the Takeda 1 benchmarks.},

@article{Zhu2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} American Nuclear Society. The lower bounds for the theoretical convergence rate of variants of the Coarse Mesh Finite Difference (CMFD) method for neutron transport acceleration are studied in this paper by generalization of the method into three categories: artificially diffusive CMFD, flux relaxation, and higher-order spatial prolongation operators. A Fourier analysis of the methods demonstrates that artificial diffusion and flux relaxation are mathematically equivalent and arbitrarily scale the coarse mesh to fine mesh projection (CMP) vector. The high-order spatial prolongation method is shown to affect the shape of the CMP vector. As a result, any of the CMFD variants based on these three sets of modifications correspond to a specific CMP vector. The optimization process is performed for the multidimensional vector, and the minimum spectral radius among all possible CMP vectors is shown to be the theoretical lower bound for the CMFD convergence rate. The spectral radius associated with the CMFD convergence rate lower bound is found to be slightly smaller (less than 0.04) than optimally diffusive CMFD(odCMFD), and the difference between odCMFD to the CMFD lower bound is much smaller than the difference between both standard CMFD and partial current-based CMFD to the CMFD lower bound. In addition, the odCMFD method has a distinct advantage in ease of implementation and minimal overhead. Conversely, the implementation necessary to achieve the CMFD lower bound would be very complicated, especially for two- and three-dimensional problems.},

@article{Zhu2016,
abstract = {A new optimally diffusive Coarse Mesh Finite Difference (odCMFD) method is proposed. The new method generalizes the Coarse Mesh Finite Difference (CMFD) and partial current-based CMFD (pCMFD) methods by adding an artificial term to the diffusion coefficient. The standard CMFD and pCMFD methods preserve the net current and partial currents respectively and can greatly reduce the spectral radius for solving neutron transport problems. Linearized Fourier analysis shows that these methods essentially differ only by the definition of the diffusion coefficient - the pCMFD diffusion coefficient contains an additional "artificial" term, usually taken to be the coarse mesh size. In this paper, the magnitude of the artificially diffusive term is numerically investigated and optimized using Fourier analysis. The results show that the optimal coefficient increases as the coarse cell optical thickness increases. Also, the optimal value is always smaller than the pCMFD value. This indicates that the pCMFD method overcorrects the diffusion coefficient which increases the spectral radius. A simple polynomial fitting was found for implementing the odCMFD in the MPACT code to perform calculations for realistic problems. Numerical MPACT results for a two-region homogeneous problem, a 2D C5G7 problem, a VERA problem 5 and a 2D BWR Peach Bottom Unit 2 core problem agree well with the Fourier analysis and confirm previous research results that: (1) CMFD converges faster than pCMFD for optically thin coarse grids, but CMFD diverges for optically thick coarse grids; (2) pCMFD is unconditionally stable for all coarse grids; and show that the newly proposed odCMFD is the most efficient among these three methods for all cases. The new method has a similar convergence rate as CMFD for optically thin coarse grids, is faster than both CMFD and pCMFD for coarse grids with intermediate optical thickness, and is unconditionally stable and faster than pCMFD for optically thick coarse grids.},

@article{Rattlesnake,
abstract = {This work presents a flexible nonlinear diffusion acceleration (NDA) method that discretizes both the SN transport equation and the diffusion equation using the discontinuous finite element method (DFEM). The method is flexible in that the diffusion equation can be discretized on a coarser mesh with the only restriction that it is nested within the transport mesh and the FEM shape function orders of the two equations can be different. The consistency of the transport and diffusion solutions at convergence is defined by using a projection operator mapping the transport into the diffusion FEM space. The diffusion weak form is based on the modified incomplete interior penalty (MIP) diffusion DFEM discretization that is extended by volumetric drift, interior face, and boundary closure terms. In contrast to commonly used coarse mesh finite difference (CMFD) methods, the presented NDA method uses a full FEM discretized diffusion equation for acceleration. Suitable projection and prolongation operators arise naturally from the FEM framework. Via Fourier analysis and numerical experiments for a one-group, fixed source problem the following properties of the NDA method are established for structured quadrilateral meshes: (1) the presented method is unconditionally stable and effective in the presence of mild material heterogeneities if the same mesh and identical shape functions either of the bilinear or biquadratic type are used, (2) the NDA method remains unconditionally stable in the presence of strong heterogeneities, (3) the NDA method with bilinear elements extends the range of effectiveness and stability by a factor of two when compared to CMFD if a coarser diffusion mesh is selected. In addition, the method is tested for solving the C5G7 multigroup, eigenvalue problem using coarse and fine mesh acceleration. While NDA does not offer an advantage over CMFD for fine mesh acceleration, it reduces the iteration count required for convergence by almost a factor of two in the case of coarse mesh acceleration.},

abstract = {Background There has been a continuous effort to design new reactors and study these reactors under different conditions. Some of these reactors have fuel pins arranged in hexagonal pitch. To study these reactors, development of computational methods and computer codes is required. For this purpose, we have developed algorithms to track two dimensional and three dimensional cluster geometries. These algorithms have been implemented in a subprogram HX7, that is implemented in the code DRAGON (Version 3.06F) to compute neutron flux distributions in these systems. Methods Computation of the neutron flux distribution requires solution of neutron transport equation. While solving this equation, by using Carlvik's method of collision probabilities, computation of tracks in the hexagonal geometries is required. In this paper we present equations that we have developed for the computation of tracks in two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) multi-hexagonal assemblies (with two rotational orientations). These equations have been implemented in a subprogram HX7, to compute tracks in seven hexagonal assemblies. The subprogram HX7 has been implemented in the NXT module of the DRAGON code, where tracks in the pins are computed. Results The results of our algorithms NXT(+HX7) have been compared with the results obtained by the EXCELT module of DRAGON (Version 3.06F). Conclusions We find that all the fluxes in 2D and fluxes in the outer pin (3D) are converging to their 3rd decimal places, in both the modules EXCELT and NXT(+HX7). For other regions 3D fluxes, in general, are converging to their first decimal places. To improve convergence of fluxes, we plan to analyze more lattices in future and study some of the reasons behind convergence. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the theoretical and numerical aspects of the AGENT code methodology accurately applied for detailed three-dimensional (3D) multigroup steady-state modeling of neutron interactions in complex heterogeneous reactor domains. For the first time we show the fine-mesh neutron scalar flux distribution in Purdue research reactor (that was built over forty years ago). The AGENT methodology is based on the unique combination of the three theories: the method of characteristics (MOC) used to simulate the neutron transport in two-dimensional (2D) whole core heterogeneous calculation, the theory of R-functions used as a mathematical tool to describe the true geometry and fuse with the MOC equations, and one-dimensional (1D) higher-order diffusion correction of 2D transport model to account for full 3D heterogeneous whole core representation. The synergism between the radial 2D transport and the 1D axial transport (to take into account the axial neutron interactions and leakage), called the 2D/1D method (used in DeCART and CHAPLET codes), provides a 3D computational solution. The unique synergism between the AGENT geometrical algorithm capable of modeling any current or future reactor core geometry and 3D neutron transport methodology is described in details. The 3D AGENT accuracy and its efficiency are demonstrated showing the eigenvalues, point-wise flux and reaction rate distributions in representative reactor geometries. The AGENT code, comprising this synergism, represents a building block of the computational system, called the virtual reactor. Its main purpose is to perform "virtual" experiments and demonstrations of various mainly university research reactor experiments. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The various forms of parallel numerical algorithms that speed up finite element computations are as different as the number of researchers working on the problem. However, most of the recently proposed concurrent computational strategies seem to have a common starting point, namely, domain decomposition. In this paper, a simple and efficient non-numerical algorithm for the automatic decomposition of an arbitrary finite element domain into a specified number of balanced subdomains is presented. It is shown that both the algorithm and its implementation are suitable for shared memory as well as local memory multiprocessors. Fortran 77 subroutines for the decomposer are given. They have proven to be extremely effective for the implementation of promising concurrent solution strategies on high performance architectures. It is hoped that the decomposer will relieve the burden of the preprocessing phase from the method's developers, so that they can concentrate on the numerical and synchronization issues of parallel computing. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

@article{VERA,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} American Nuclear Society. This paper describes the methodology developed and implemented in the Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications Core Simulator (VERA-CS) to perform high-fidelity, pressurized water reactor (PWR), multicycle, core physics calculations. Depletion of the core with pin-resolved power and nuclide detail is a significant advance in the state of the art for reactor analysis, providing the level of detail necessary to address the problems of the U.S. Department of Energy Nuclear Reactor Simulation Hub, the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL). VERA-CS has three main components: the neutronics solver MPACT, the thermal-hydraulic (T-H) solver COBRA-TF (CTF), and the nuclide transmutation solver ORIGEN. This paper focuses on MPACT and provides an overview of the resonance self-shielding methods, macroscopic-cross-section calculation, two-dimensional/one-dimensional (2-D/1-D) transport, nuclide depletion, T-H feedback, and other supporting methods representing a minimal set of the capabilities needed to simulate high-fidelity models of a commercial nuclear reactor. Results are presented from the simulation of a model of the first cycle of Watts Bar Unit 1. The simulation is within 16 parts per million boron (ppmB) reactivity for all state points compared to cycle measurements, with an average reactivity bias of {\textless} 5 ppmB for the entire cycle. Comparisons to cycle 1 flux map data are also provided, and the average 2-D root-mean-square (rms) error during cycle 1 is 1.07{\%}. To demonstrate the multicycle capability, a state point at beginning of cycle (BOC) 2 was also simulated and compared to plant data. The comparison of the cycle 2 BOC state has a reactivity difference of +3 ppmB from measurement, and the 2-D rms of the comparison in the flux maps is 1.77{\%}. These results provide confidence in VERA-CS's capability to perform high-fidelity calculations for practical PWR reactor problems.},

To begin, we discuss a model problem (with nonlinear cross section feedback) and its justification. We proceed with a Fourier analysis for source iteration schemes applied to the model problem. Then we analyze commonly-used iteration schemes involving non-linear diffusion acceleration and feedback. For each scheme we show (1) that they are conditionally stable, (2) the conditions that lead to instability, and (3) that traditional relaxation approaches can improve stability. Lastly, we propose a new iteration scheme that theory predicts is an improvement upon the existing methods.},

abstract = {A key challenge for full-core transport methods is reactor agnostic multi-group cross section (MGXS) generation. Monte Carlo (MC) presents the most accurate method for MGXS generation since it does not require any approximations to the neutron flux. This paper introduces a framework that replaces the traditional multi-level approach to MGXS generation with a single MC calculation to generate the fine-spatial mesh MGXS that are needed by high-fidelity transport codes. In addition, three pin-wise spatial homogenization schemes are introduced to model inter-pin spatial self-shielding spectral effects with varying levels of spatial fidelity. Most notably, the Local Neighbor Symmetry (LNS) scheme uses a nearest neighbor-like analysis of a reactor geometry to determine which fuel pins should be assigned the same MGXS. The single-step MGXS framework with the three spatial homogenization schemes are evaluated for two PWR benchmarks. The results demonstrate the potential for single-step MC simulations of the complete heterogeneous geometry as a means to generate reactor agnostic MGXS for deterministic transport codes.},

Furthermore, it has been shown that Anderson acceleration (AA) could be used to speed up neutron transport and plasma physics calculations. In this paper, we combine these ideas to demonstrate that AA can be used to remedy the degraded performance of NDA when scattering is anisotropic.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The method of characteristics (MOC) with matrix form has more favorable performance compared with its standard application. However, it is observed that the advantage decreases when the physical problem size becomes larger. The spatial domain decomposition method (DDM) is a better remedy to reduce computation burden for large scale problem, but increasing the outer iterations due to the decoupling between flat source regions. To overcome this drawback, the straightforward multi-domain coupling technique is studied and utilized in the current study based on a track truncation method (TTM). The resulting linear system is solved using preconditioned generalized minimal residual (PGMRES) method, a variant of Krylov subspace method. Numerical results for benchmark problems demonstrate the proposed acceleration technique is efficient in terms of memory usage and computation time without compromising accuracy for both hexagonal and rectangular geometries. For the large scale problem, it shows an ideal linear relationship between the memory/time required and the physical problem size rather than quadratic growth as before.},

We describe these algorithms and sketch a " proof " that they will always execute the full eight-octant sweep in the minimum possible number of stages for a given P x × P y × P z partitioning. A stage includes each processor choosing a task to execute, if at least one is available, and communicating its result to downstream neighbors. A task is an aggregation of cells, directions, and energy groups. Our computational results demonstrate that our optimal scheduling algorithms do execute sweeps in the minimum possible stage count, and further they agree reasonably well with our performance model. An older version of our PDT transport code achieves almost 80{\%} parallel efficiency on 131,072 cores, on a weak-scaling problem with only one energy group, 80 directions, and 4096 cells/core. A newer version is less efficient at present—we are still improving its implementation—but still achieves almost 60{\%} parallel efficiency on 393,216 cores.

The mobile-chord method is implemented in the AEGIS code, which is a lattice physics code based on the MOC. Verification calculations are carried out for the pin-cell and whole core geometries of the C5G7 benchmark problem by using UO2and mixed oxide (MOX) fuels. The calculation results indicate that the spatial discretization error in the mobile-chord method is smaller than that in the equidistant ray tracing method, which is commonly used in conventional MOC codes.

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new multilevel in space and energy diffusion (MSED) method for solving multigroup diffusion eigenvalue problems. The MSED method can be described as a PI scheme with three additional features: (1) a grey (one-group) diffusion equation used to efficiently converge the fission source and eigenvalue, (2) a space-dependent Wielandt shift technique used to reduce the number of PIs required, and (3) a multigrid-in-space linear solver for the linear solves required by each PI step. In MSED, the convergence of the solution of the multigroup diffusion eigenvalue problem is accelerated by performing work on lower-order equations with only one group and/or coarser spatial grids. Results from several Fourier analyses and a one-dimensional test code are provided to verify the efficiency of the MSED method and to justify the incorporation of the grey diffusion equation and the multigrid linear solver. These results highlight the potential efficiency of the MSED method as a solver for multidimensional multigroup diffusion eigenvalue problems, and they serve as a proof of principle for future work. Our ultimate goal is to implement the MSED method as an efficient solver for the two-dimensional/three-dimensional coarse mesh finite difference diffusion system in the Michigan parallel characteristics transport code. The work in this paper represents a necessary step towards that goal.},

abstract = {The purpose of the PAPI project is to specify a standard application programming interface (API) for accessing hardware performance counters available on most modern microprocessors. These counters exist as a small set of registers that count events, which are occurrences of specific signals related to the processor's function. Monitoring these events facilitates correlation between the structure of source/object code and the efficiency of the mapping of that code to the underlying architecture. This correlation has a variety of uses in performance analysis including hand tuning, compiler optimization, debugging, benchmarking, monitoring and performance modeling. In addition, it is hoped that this information will prove useful in the development of new compilation technology as well as in steering architectural development towards alleviating commonly occurring bottlenecks in high performance computing.},

abstract = {The method of short characteristics is extended to two-dimensional heterogeneous Cartesian cells. The new application is intended for realistic pin-by-pin lattice calculations with an exact representation of the geometric shape of the pins, without need for homogenization. The method keeps the advantages of conventional discrete ordinates methods, such as fast execution, together with the possibility to deal with a large number of spatial meshes. Expansion bases, spatial integration, and balance conservation are discussed. A Fourier analysis of the method shows that the scheme preserves the asymptotic behavior of analytical transport. Two coarse-mesh finite difference acceleration techniques have also been analyzed and generalized with the use of Eddington's factors to speed up the rate of convergence of the inner iterations. Numerical examples for realistic configurations show the precision of the method and the efficiency of the accelerated iterations. An analytical stability analysis is also presented for studying the nonconverged behavior of the accelerated scheme, and we give numerical proof of chaotic behavior and the existence of bifurcations.},

Compared with the 2D/1D method, because of the better axial leakage from the 3D SNmethod, the 2D/3D could decrease the number of MOC layers while keeping the accuracy. In another word, it could improve the accuracy with the same axial mesh size. In the paper, the theory and leakage analysis of this 2D/3D coupling method is introduced. And a small test problem is given to show the leakage comparison of axial leakage between the 2D/1D method and 2D/3D method. Finally the results of the 3D C5G7 problems are given to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the 2D/3D method.},

The negative self-scattering cross-section may lead to a negative impact on the convergence behavior for the method of characteristics (MOC), especially in a problem with large moderator regions containing hydrogen. In order to address this issue, the spectral radius of the inner iteration of MOC is theoretically estimated for various self-scattering cross-sections. It is found that the spectral radius of the inner iteration of MOC could exceed unity for a large negative self-scattering cross-section, which results in numerical divergence. A countermeasure for the divergence using the successive over relaxation method is also discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report the development and verification of a method of characteristics (MOC) code, PEACH, at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Both the usual flat-source step characteristics (SC) scheme and the linear source (LS) approximation scheme are adopted for the tracking calculation along the neutron trajectory. The assembly-based modular ray tracing (AMRT) technique that possesses a good geometric flexibility and high efficiency is employed, which makes PEACH able to deal with practical LWR assembly and core problems. Moreover, in order to reduce the computational time of the MOC iteration process, both the multi/few-group two-level cell-based coarse mesh finite difference (CMFD) acceleration and the exponential function interpolation technique are used. This results in a significant acceleration. Numerical results for the OECD NEA C5G7 MOX benchmark problem and a 69-group BWR mini-core problem demonstrate that PEACH is accurate and efficient. Numerical results also demonstrate that the LS scheme is more efficient than the SC scheme, taking less time and system memory to generate results of comparable accuracy. In addition, we find that MOC with CMFD acceleration always converges with almost the same number of outer iterations regardless of the physical problem size and the discretization parameters used. This shows an ideal linear relationship between the run time and the geometric size of the problem. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Two categories of schemes are available for integrating the propagation equations: (1) the first category is based on exact integration and leads to the classical step characteristics (SC) and linear discontinuous characteristics (LDC) schemes and (2) the second category leads to diamond differencing schemes of various orders in space. The acceleration of these MOC schemes using a combination of the generalized minimal residual [GMRES(m)] method preconditioned with the ACA technique was focused on.

In this paper, we show that spectral partitioning methods work well on bounded-degree planar graphs and finite element meshes-the classes of graphs to which they are usually applied. While naive spectral bisection does not necessarily work, we prove that spectral partitioning techniques can be used to produce separators whose ratio of vertices removed to edges cut is O (sqrt(n)) for bounded-degree planar graphs and two-dimensional meshes and O(n1/d) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes. The heart of our analysis is an upper bound on the second-smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrices of these graphs: we prove a bound of O(1/n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and O(1/n2/d) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

This paper presents extensions of the traditional concepts of local reaction rate preservation (common in discontinuity factor, SPH, and BBH methods), to derive a new state-of-the-art transport equivalence method that incorporates angular flux jump conditions that provide polar angle neutron current preservation. This method is tested on numerous fixed-source pin-cell problems by condensing fine energy resonance fluxes and cross sections.

Denovo uses the Koch-Baker-Alcouffe parallel sweep algorithm to obtain high parallel efficiency on O(100) processors on XYZ orthogonal meshes. As opposed to traditional Sn codes that use source iteration, Denovo uses nonstationary Krylov methods to solve the within-group equations. Krylov methods are far more efficient than stationary schemes. Additionally, classic acceleration schemes (diffusion synthetic acceleration) do not suffer stability problems when used as a preconditioner to a Krylov solver. Denovo's generic programming framework allows multiple spatial discretizatoin schemes and solution methodologies. Denovo currently provides diamond-difference, theta-weighted diamond-difference, linear-discontinuous finite element, trilinear-discontinuous finite element, and step characteristics spatial differencing schemes. Also, users have the toption of running traditional source iteration instead of Krylov iteration. Multigroup upscatterer problems can be solved using Gauss-Seidel iteration with transport, two-grid acceleration. A parallel first-collision source is also available. Denovo solutions to the Kobayashi benchmarks are in excellent agreement with published results. Parallel performance shows excellent weak scaling up to 20,000 cores and good scaling up to 40,000 cores.},

In modern sodium fast reactors that rely on heterogeneous core designs, anisotropy in the neutron propagation cannot be neglected, so three-dimensional (3D) models should be used to efficiently compute those effective cross sections. In this paper, the 2D/1D approximation is carried out to overcome computationally expensive 3D calculations while preserving consistent angular representations of the neutron flux. An iterative procedure is defined to solve the 2D/1D equations and produce coarse group homogenized cross sections that account for 3D transport effects.

So in this work the application of MFree collocation method is examined to solve SNneutron transport equation. The MFree collocation method uses the formulation of strong form which is truly mesh less method. Since MFree method is flexible for distributing arbitrary and irregular nodes, this method can be easily applied for high heterogeneous nuclear reactor problems with complicated geometry. To validate the proposed method some test problems including regular and irregular geometries have been modeled. Our results show that the mesh free collocation method can be used for discrete ordinate neutron transport equation as an efficient and accurate method without hardness and limitations of the mesh-based methods like finite element method.},

The characteristics routine employs the CACTUS algorithm for drawing ray tracing lines, which assists the two key features of the flux solution in the CHAPLET code. One is the direct neutron path linking (DNPL) technique which strictly connects angular fluxes at each assembly interface in the flux solution separated between assemblies. Another is to reduce the required memory storage by sharing the data related to ray tracing among assemblies with the same configuration. For faster computation, the coarse mesh rebalance (CMR) method and the Aitken method were incorporated in the code and the combined use of both methods showed the most promising acceleration performance among the trials. In addition, the parallelization of the flux solution was attempted...},

Generating the tracks to use in a 3D Method of Characteristics (MOC) simulation is not a trivial task. The method used to generate tracks has significant implications on the memory and compute requirements for a problem and the current track generation methods have shortcomings. In this study, we provide a detailed description and analysis of the current state of the art method to generate tracks for direct 3D MOC, the Modular Ray Tracing (MRT) method. Additionally, a new global method for generating tracks is presented that is generalizable to many geometries, domain decomposition schemes, and quadrature sets. The main difference between the global and modular track generation approaches is that the global approach does not require any knowledge of the underlying geometry discretization and is therefore more flexible in domain decomposing the geometry. Some considerations with memory requirements and general applicability that we and others have found are discussed.},

We derived an example of such a transposition starting from the linear characteristic scheme. This new scheme is compared with the standard flat-source approximation of the step characteristic scheme and with the diamond differencing scheme.

The method of characteristics, which has the merit of treating heterogeneous geometry explicitly, is utilized in AEGIS as a neutron transport solver. So, the AEGIS code can explicitly model many types of fuel lattices in both commercial light water reactors (LWRs) and advanced reactors such as Generation IV reactors. The AEGIS code can also treat higher-order anisotropic scattering accurately based on spherical harmonics expansion. To compute a large-scale problem, a nonuniform ray-tracing method is implemented in AEGIS. It utilizes the Gauss-Legendre quadrature weight and the macroband method to decide position and width of ray traces to reduce spatial discretization error efficiently. The transport solution of AEGIS has been verified through various benchmark problems. It was found that the AEGIS code can explicitly treat complicated geometry and can efficiently solve a large-scale problem. These results show that flexibility in handling geometry and the very rigorous neutronics calculation models of AEGIS will contribute to predicting neutronics characteristics accurately, not only for commercial LWRs but also for advanced reactors.},

Different partitioning strategies are compared in two case studies involving multiblock grids. One of the applications is a profile of a multi-element wing from Airbus A310. The partition properties from the different strategies and algorithms depend very much on the number of subgrids and their sizes as well as on the number of processors.

The discretization error of polar angle in MOC can be considered as an approximation error of the Bickley function used in the collision probability method; the Bickley function is numerically integrated in MOC using a quadrature set for polar direction (i.e., a set of polar angles and weights). Therefore, by choosing an appropriate quadrature set, the approximation error of the Bickley function which appears in MOC can be reduced, thus the calculation accuracy of MOC increases. Quadrature sets from one to three polar angle divisions are derived by minimizing the maximum approximation error of the Bickley function. The newly derived polar angle quadrature set (Tabuchi-Yamamoto or the TY quadrature set) is tested in the C5G7 and 4-loop PWR whole core problems and its accuracy is compared with other quadrature sets, e.g., Gauss...},

abstract = {Several schemes for the linear mapping of a multidimensional space$\backslash$nhave been proposed for various applications, such as access methods for$\backslash$nspatio-temporal databases and image compression. In these applications,$\backslash$none of the most desired properties from such linear mappings is$\backslash$nclustering, which means the locality between objects in the$\backslash$nmultidimensional space being preserved in the linear space. It is widely$\backslash$nbelieved that the Hilbert space-filling curve achieves the best$\backslash$nclustering (Abel and Mark, 1990; Jagadish, 1990). We analyze the$\backslash$nclustering property of the Hilbert space-filling curve by deriving$\backslash$nclosed-form formulas for the number of clusters in a given query region$\backslash$nof an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra). Both the$\backslash$nasymptotic solution for the general case and the exact solution for a$\backslash$nspecial case generalize previous work. They agree with the empirical$\backslash$nresults that the number of clusters depends on the hypersurface area of$\backslash$nthe query region and not on its hypervolume. We also show that the$\backslash$nHilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z curve. From a$\backslash$npractical point of view, the formulas given provide a simple measure$\backslash$nthat can be used to predict the required disk access behaviors and,$\backslash$nhence, the total access time},

abstract = {The point we made in this paper is that, although detailed and precise three-dimensional (3D) whole-core transport calculations may be obtained in the future with massively parallel computers, they would have an application to only some of the problems of the nuclear industry, more precisely those regarding multiphysics or for methodology validation or nuclear safety calculations. On the other hand, typical design reactor cycle calculations comprising many one-point core calculations can have very strict constraints in computing time and will not directly benefit from the advances in computations in large scale computers. Consequently, in this paper we review some of the deterministic 3D transport methods which in the very near future may have potential for industrial applications and, even with low-order approximations such as a low resolution in energy, might represent an advantage as compared with present industrial methodology, for which one of the main approximations is due to power reconstruction. These methods comprise the response-matrix method and methods based on the two-dimensional (2D) method of characteristics, such as the fusion method.},

The resulting 3-D CMFD problem is thus solved as an isolated problem.

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new multilevel in space and energy diffusion (MSED) method for solving multigroup diffusion eigenvalue problems. The MSED method can be described as a PI scheme with three additional features: (1) a grey (one-group) diffusion equation used to efficiently converge the fission source and eigenvalue, (2) a space-dependent Wielandt shift technique used to reduce the number of PIs required, and (3) a multigrid-in-space linear solver for the linear solves required by each PI step. In MSED, the convergence of the solution of the multigroup diffusion eigenvalue problem is accelerated by performing work on lower-order equations with only one group and/or coarser spatial grids. Results from several Fourier analyses and a one-dimensional test code are provided to verify the efficiency of the MSED method and to justify the incorporation of the grey diffusion equation and the multigrid linear solver. These results highlight the potential efficiency of the MSED method as a solver for multidimensional multigroup diffusion eigenvalue problems, and they serve as a proof of principle for future work. Our ultimate goal is to implement the MSED method as an efficient solver for the two-dimensional/three-dimensional coarse mesh finite difference diffusion system in the Michigan parallel characteristics transport code. The work in this paper represents a necessary step towards that goal.},

@inproceedings{Fitzgerald2019,
abstract = {This work seeks to improve upon an existing formulation of the method of characteristics with linear source approximation in cases with non-constant cross sections. The previous formulation relies on pre-computed coefficients that are dependent on the multi-group total or transport cross sections. The method is reformulated to eliminate the cross section dependence of the pre-computed coefficients without adding additional operations, thus increasing the efficiency in multiphysics and 2D/1D simulations. The new formulation is implemented in the MPACT code and tested on several problems: 2D zero-power lattice calculations, 2D lattice depletion calculations, and 3D assembly models with T/H feedback. This work demonstrates that with the new linear source formulation, the number of mesh elements can be significantly reduced while maintaining accuracy, leading to reduced run-times for cases with fixed cross sections. Furthermore, it demonstrates that this is also possible for cases with depletion and thermal hydraulic feedback. In the 2D lattice depletion cases, total run-time is reduced by an average of 20{\%}, and memory usage is reduced by 19{\%}. In the 3D assembly case with T/H feedback, the total run-time is only effectively reduced by 4{\%}, but memory usage is still reduced by 21{\%}.},

The verification of the improved method was performed by comparing the sensitivities with MCNP6 and TSUNAMI-1D.

These quadratures have the advantage over the standard level-symmetric LQn quadrature sets in that the weights are positive for all orders, and the transport solution may be systematically converged by increasing the order of the quadrature set. As the order of the quadrature is increased, the points approach a uniform continuous distribution on the unit sphere, and the quadrature is invariant with respect to spatial rotations. The numberical integrals converge for continuous functions as the order of the quadrature is increased. The numerical characteristics of the UEn quadrature set have been investigated previously. In this paper, numerical calculations are performed to evaluate the application of the UGn quadrature set in typical transport analyses. A series of DORT transport calculations of the {\textgreater}1-MeV neutron flux have been performed for a set of pressure-vessel fluence benchmark problems. these calculations employed the UGn (n=8, 12, 16, 24, and 32) quadratures and indicate that the UGn solutions have converged to within {\~{}}0.25{\%}.

The analysis of the exact boundary-condition treatment is carried out for finite domains and infinite lattices, where periodic trajectories must be used. Albedo-like boundary conditions may be used to approximate exact geometrical motions via spatially piecewise constant and either piecewise constant or discrete angular approximations for the boundary fluxes. We also have examined angular product quadrature formulas and shown that the recently proposed Bickley-Naylor quadratures do not respect particle conservation in the presence of anisotropy of scattering. Numerical examples show that the approximated albedo-type boundary method converges toward the results obtained with the exact boundary treatment. However, because of problems related to the multigroup implementation , numerical extra burden in group iterations prevents the efficient use of approximated boundary conditions for multigroup calculations. Nevertheless, this method remains a candidate of choice for use in multidomain calculations via interface boundary fluxes.},

Finally, high leakage cases, the C5G7 and VERA benchmark are tested to show the accuracy and performance of the proposed method.},

abstract = {The anisotropic scattering effect to keff is studied for UO2and MOX fueled BWR assemblies. The anisotropic scattering effect increases the assembly k∞by 0.44{\%} $\Delta$k for the UO2assembly with 0{\%} void fraction, and by 0.21{\%} $\Delta$k for the MOX assembly with 0{\%} void fraction. This is because the anisotropic scattering effect flattens the intra-assembly thermal flux, and the absorption rate in the surrounding water gap is decreased, but the absorption rates in the MOX fuel rods are increased compared to the UO2rods. Therefore, the total decrease in absorption rates in the UO2assembly is relatively large, and the k∞is increased in the UO2assembly. The dependence of the anisotropic scattering effect on the void fraction is investigated, and the significant difference of 0.62{\%} $\Delta$k/k is found for the 0{\%} and the 80{\%} void fractions. The BWR assemblies with Gd rods are also considered. Furthermore, the usefulness of the transport cross section is investigated, and it is found that the transport cross section gives reasonable anisotropic scattering effect, though not satisfactory. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} American Nuclear Society. A three-dimensional variational nodal method (VNM) is presented for pressurized water reactor core calculations without fuel-moderator homogenization. The nodal functional is presented and discretized to obtain response matrix equations.Within the nodes, finite elements in the x-y plane and orthogonal polynomials in z are used to approximate the spatial flux distribution. On the lateral interfaces, orthogonal polynomials are employed. On the axial interfaces, the finite elements facilitate a spatially accurate current representation that has proven to be a challenge for the method of characteristics-based two-dimensional/one-dimensional approximations which typically rely on spatial homogenization. The angular discretization utilizes an evenparity integral method within the nodes, with the integrals evaluated using high-order Chebyshev-Legendre cubature. On the lateral and axial interfaces, low-order spherical harmonics (P n ) are augmented by high-order P n expansions to which quasi-reflected conditions are applied. With quasi-reflected conditions, the solution converges to the high-order P n solution for an infinite lattice of identical cells with no gradient, while the loworder P n expansions handle global gradients in both the radial and axial directions. The method is implemented in the PANX code and applied first to a number of model problems to study convergence of the space-angle approximations and then to the C5G7 benchmark problems. Multigroup Monte Carlo solutions provide reference values for eigenvalues and pin-power distributions.},

abstract = {Recently, several domain partitioning algorithms have been proposed to effect load-balancing among processors in parallel finite element analysis. The recursive spectral bisection (RSB) algorithm [1] has been shown to be effective. However, the bisection nature of the RSB results in partitions of an integer power of two, which is too restrictive for computing environments consisting of an arbitrary number of processors. This paper presents two recursive spectral partitioning algorithms, both of which generalize the RSB algorithm for an arbitrary number of partitions. These algorithms are based on a graph partitioning approach which includes spectral techniques and graph representation of finite element meshes. The 'algebraic connectivity vector' is introduced as a parameter to assess the quality of the partitioning results. Both node-based and element-based partitioning strategies are discussed. The spectral algorithms are also evaluated and compared for coarse-grained partitioning using different types of structures modelled by 1-D, 2-D and 3-D finite elements. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the additional storage overhead needed for a parallel implementation of finite element applications. In particular, we compare the storage requirements for the factorization of the sparse matrices that would occur on a parallel processor vs. a uniprocessor. This variation in storage results from the factorization fill-in. We address the question of whether the storage overhead is so large for parallel implementations that it imposes severe limitations on the problem size in contrast to the problems executed sequentially on a uniprocessor. The storage requirements for the parallel implementation are based upon a new ordering scheme, the combination mesh-based scheme. This scheme uses a domain decomposition method which attempts to balance the processors' loads and decreases the interprocessor communication. The storage requirements for the sequential implementation is based upon the minimum degree algorithm. The difference between the two storage requirements corresponds to the storage overhead attributed to the parallel scheme. Experiments were conducted on regular and irregular, 2-D and 3-D problems. The meshes were decomposed into 2–256 subdomains which can be executed on 2–256 processors, respectively. The total storage requirements or fill-in for most of the 2-D problems were less than a factor of two increase over the sequential execution. In contrast, large 3-D problems had zero increase in storage or fill-in over the sequential execution; the fill-in was less for the parallel execution than the sequential execution. Thus, we conclude that the storage overhead attributed to the use of parallel processors will not impose severe constraints on the problem size. Further, for large 3-D applications, the combination mesh-based algorithm does better than minimum degree for reducing the fill-in.},

abstract = {A new 2D neutron transport code AutoMOC for arbitrary geometry has been developed. This code is based on the method of characteristics (MOCs) and the customization of AutoCAD. The MOC solves the neutron transport equation along characteristic lines. It is independent of the geometric shape of boundaries and regions. So theoretically, this method can be used to solve the neutron transport equation in highly complex geometries. However, it is important to describe the geometry and calculate intersection points of each characteristic line with every boundary and region in advance. In complex geometries, due to the complications of treating the arbitrary domain, the selection of geometric shapes and efficiency of ray tracing are generally limited. The geometry treatment through the customization of AutoCAD, a widely used computer-aided design software package, is given in this paper. Thanks to the powerful capability of AutoCAD, the description of arbitrary geometry becomes quite convenient. Moreover, with the language Visual Basic for Applications (VBAs), AutoCAD can be customized to carry out the ray tracing procedure with a high flexibility in geometry. The numerical results show that AutoMOC can solve 2D neutron transport problems in a complex geometry accurately and effectively. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The method of characteristics (MOC) solves the transport equation along straight lines, called characteristics, of the system. Along these lines the differential operator of the Boltzmann equation reduces to a total derivative. The MOC methodology does not impose any limitation on geometry and allows for an accurate treatment of highly heterogeneous systems. However, the actual treatment of arbitrary domains in terms of their flexible description and efficient ray tracing does impose difficulties which limited broader application of MOC in reactor analysis. Most of the existing MOC codes describe the geometry by lines and arcs with extensive input data, have difficulty in sub-meshing, require a pre-defined condition of closed rays at starting points limiting the boundary shape, and need a large number of polar angles which prolong the execution time. A new MOC code, ANEMONA, has been developed to remove all these geometrical limitations. This unified and easy-to-use method is based on an R-function solid modeler approach that can account for all heterogeneities with full flexibility in domain description, ray map generation, ray tracing and boundary types. The ANEMONA's methodology has many advantages: an easy description of arbitrary domains and meshing; allowed mismatch of the reflected rays; calculation of the reflected angular flux as the boundary mesh average; use of only two adequately chosen polar angles; and the reduction in computational time by energy-dependent azimuthal ray map. ANEMONA has been tested on a number of benchmark problems with excellent results.},

The promise that the graphics cards have shown in the field of image processing and accelerated rendering of 3D scenes, and the computational capability that these GPUs possess, they are developing into great parallel computing units. It is quite simple to program a graphics processor to perform general parallel tasks. But after understanding the various architectural aspects of the graphics processor, it can be used to perform other taxing tasks as well. In this paper, we will show how CUDA can fully utilize the tremendous power of these GPUs. CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing architecture. It enables dramatic increases in computing performance, by harnessing the power of the GPU. This paper talks about CUDA and its architecture. It takes us through a comparison of CUDA C/C++ with other parallel programming languages like OpenCL and DirectCompute. The paper also lists out the common myths about CUDA and how the future seems to be promising for CUDA.},

abstract = {The manycore revolution can be characterized by increasing thread counts, decreasing memory per thread, and diversity of continually evolving manycore architectures. High performance computing (HPC) applications and libraries must exploit increasingly finer levels of parallelism within their codes to sustain scalability on these devices. A major obstacle to performance portability is the diverse and conflicting set of constraints on memory access patterns across devices. Contemporary portable programming models address manycore parallelism (e.g., OpenMP, OpenACC, OpenCL) but fail to address memory access patterns. The Kokkos C++ library enables applications and domain libraries to achieve performance portability on diverse manycore architectures by unifying abstractions for both fine-grain data parallelism and memory access patterns. In this paper we describe Kokkos' abstractions, summarize its application programmer interface (API), present performance results for unit-test kernels and mini-applications, and outline an incremental strategy for migrating legacy C++ codes to Kokkos. The Kokkos library is under active research and development to incorporate capabilities from new generations of manycore architectures, and to address a growing list of applications and domain libraries.},

abstract = {Specialized tracking techniques have been developed for a step-characteristics transport solver. These techniques strongly exploit the regularities of extruded 3D axial geometries to reduce the number of operations and the memory requirements of the transport solver. The method of compound trajectories has been applied to exactly treat geometrical boundary conditions with a minimum number of trajectories. The chord classification method consists in identifying recognized types of chords that share the same length. It allows a consistent reduction of the number of chords that have to be stored and also an important speed up of the transport iterations thanks to the pre-computed values of escape coefficients. An alternative storage method has also been implemented: in this method one trajectory is represented by a partial record which is used to reconstruct the trajectories on-the-fly. Numerical tests show good improvements for both memory and computational time. Optimized methods have also been developed for horizontal and vertical directions, which are particularly advantageous in terms of computational costs. In the same contest, a modified version of the Minimized-Bickley quadrature (Sanchez et al., 2002) containing these directions is proposed. The new methods have been tested by comparison with standard quadrature sets. Results show that for some cases the special directions improve the efficiency of the solver, while for some others the opposite effect is obtained.},

@article{Eklund2016,
abstract = {In this paper a newly developed thermal hydraulics (TH) code coupled with the state-of-the-art neutronics deterministic code AGENT (Arbitrary Geometry Neutron Transport) is presented. This coupled system is called the AGENT-TH scheme. The neutronics AGENT code uniquely combines the method of characteristics (MOC) and R-function geometrical modeling to solve the 2D/3D neutron transport in nuclear reactors of current or future designs. Commonly, the cross sections are prepared using the SCALE code system. The implementation of the TH code with AGENT enables coupled thermal-hydraulic and neutronics analysis in providing the average reactor fuel temperatures. This allows for an accurate overall power profiling within the reactor system, which affects reactor coolant temperature, neutron flux, and other associated reactor parameters. The two main types of LWRs are boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The BWRs operate at lower pressures than PWRs, which results in a higher void fraction, or fraction of coolant flow which is vapor versus liquid. Performances of PWRs, with a higher operating pressure, may be obtained using the homogeneous equilibrium mixture (HEM) model, which assumes a slip relation equal to one between the coolant liquid and vapor phases. To account for the higher void fraction in the BWR coolant, the BWRs properties are assessed based on the drift flux model. The thermal hydraulics drift flux model is developed as a part of the TH code, to address the two-phase flow associated with two-phase heat transfer (including subcooled nucleation and saturated boiling) as found in BWR systems. This is accomplished based on the drift flux equations in 1D steady-state conditions, which permits fast computation times without sacrificing final accuracy. The TH code is benchmarked against the reactor simulation code TRACE for a single pin to assess the thermal-hydraulics capabilities of the drift flux model for the fluid void fraction, flow quality, pressure, saturation temperature, and mixture temperature along the axial height of the pin. The drift flux thermal hydraulics module is coupled with AGENT using a radial heat transfer model taking into account heat transfer from the fuel centerline to the bulk fluid. Fuel temperatures calculated in the TH code are used to update cross sections from the SCALE code system to account for thermal feedback. Reasonable agreements are obtained between the AGENT-TH and TRACE for the presented benchmark examples.},

The significant figure of the analysis is that high-order spatial expansions allow for the treatment of coarser meshes while preserving the same accuracy of the step characteristics with finer grids.

abstract = {Recently, a uniform equal-weight quadrature set, UEn, and a uniform Gauss-weight quadrature set, UGn, have been derived. These quadratures have the advantage over the standard level-symmetric LQn quadrature sets in that the weights are positive for all orders, and the transport solution may be systematically converged by increasing the order of the quadrature set. As the order of the quadrature is increased, the points approach a uniform continuous distribution on the unit sphere, and the quadrature is invariant with respect to spatial rotations. The numberical integrals converge for continuous functions as the order of the quadrature is increased. The numerical characteristics of the UEn quadrature set have been investigated previously. In this paper, numerical calculations are performed to evaluate the application of the UGn quadrature set in typical transport analyses. A series of DORT transport calculations of the {\textgreater}1-MeV neutron flux have been performed for a set of pressure-vessel fluence benchmark problems. these calculations employed the UGn (n=8, 12, 16, 24, and 32) quadratures and indicate that the UGn solutions have converged to within {\~{}}0.25{\%}. The converged UGn solutions are found to be comparable to the UEn results and are more accurate than the level-symmetric S16 predictions.},

In the limit of a homogeneous hydrogen slab, the new method is shown to be equivalent to the long-used, and only-recently-published CASMO transport correction method employed for production LWR analysis. Results demonstrate that CMM can produce rigorous few-group assembly-homogenized diffusion coefficients directly from heterogeneous Monte Carlo lattice tallies—without requiring the intermediate step of tallying of fine-group cross section data commonly required for P1or B1calculations of diffusion coefficients. Comparisons with several common diffusion coefficient approximations are made for both simple homogeneous media and fully heterogeneous lattices. CMM is demonstrated to produce 2-group diffusion data for the BEAVRS PWR lattices, as well as 11-group directional-dependent diffusion coefficients for the TREAT graphite/fuel lattices. Core flux distributions and eigenvalues computed using CMM diffusion coefficients are demonstrated to be more accurate than those obtained with traditional methods for approximating diffusion coefficients.},

abstract = {In this paper we present two new numerical schemes for the method of characteristic in unstructured geometries (MOC) for the neutron transport equation. The MOC has become a familiar tool for transport calculations in reactor physics [1], and its use will probably increase in the future. One of the major drawbacks of the MOC is the difficulty to implement higher-order integration schemes to improve spatial convergence. We present here two high-order schemes for the MOC, the second being a direct generalization of the first. We define a positive, linear characteristic scheme based on linear interpolation on the surface's values of the collisions sources. We have called it Linear Surface (LS) scheme. Results comparisons of the well-known Stepanek benchmark show LS faster convergence over the standard step characteristic scheme. A generalization of the synthetic ASA acceleration scheme provides an efficient method to accelerate the internal transport iterations. However, the LS scheme is not conservative. To improve this scheme we have adopted a nonlinear rebalancing procedure. The result is a Non-Linear Surface (NLS) scheme permitting linear variation of the source but also source discontinuities that enforce neutron conservation. The comparisons of the results for the Stepanek benchmark show that this method is much better with respect to spatial convergence. Unfortunately the nonlinear nature of the scheme complicates the conception of an acceleration method.},

The improved method has been used to calculate sensitivity coefficients relative to infinite dilution cross-sections with self-shielding effect taken into account. Two types of reactivities are considered: Doppler reactivity and coolant void reactivity. For each type of reactivity, the sensitivities are calculated for small and large changes of reactivity. The results have demonstrated that the sensitivities are dependent on the changes of reactivity, and the reactivity variation uncertainty is larger than the eigenvalue uncertainty. In addition, the uncertainty of coolant void reactivity is much greater than Doppler reactivity especially for large changes of reactivity because the contribution of U-238 inelastic scattering becomes large. The sensitivity coefficients and uncertainties of both reactivities were verified by comparing with SCALE code results using ENDF/B-VII library and good agreements have been found.},

abstract = {We are investigating a new class of linear characteristics schemes along finite-length tracks for solving the transport equation for neutral particles with scattering anisotropy. These algorithms are based on diamond differencing, as implemented with the method of discrete ordinates. The quadratic- order diamond-differencing (DD1) scheme is based on linear discontinuous coefficients that are derived through the application of approximations describing the mesh-averaged spatial flux moments in terms of spatial source moments and of the beginning- and end-of-segment flux values. This DD1 linear charac- teristics scheme is inherently conservative. This approach is an improvement relative to other linear characteristics schemes because no information needs to be collected on internal surfaces. Consequently, the DD1 scheme is compatible with existing tracking files for the collision-probability method. The pro- posed scheme is verified in one-dimensional slab geometry where it is found to be equivalent to a discrete ordinates solution and on simple two-dimensional benchmarks made of regular squares or hexagons.},

The performance of the code in the aspect of solution accuracy and computing speed is then examined using the applications to the C5G7MOX benchmark and its modified rodded variation problems and also to a three-dimensional core case involving thermal feedback.

@article{Zheng2017,
abstract = {A new approach based on the method of characteristics (MOC) is proposed to solve the neutron transport equation. A new three-dimensional (3D) spatial discretization is applied to avoid the instability issue of the transverse leakage iteration of the traditional 2D/1D approach. In this new approach, the axial and radial variables are discretized in two different ways: the linear expansion is performed in the axial direction, then, the 3D solution of the angular flux is transformed to be the planar solution of 2D angular expansion moments, which are solved by the planar MOC sweeping. Based on the boundary and interface continuity conditions, the 2D expansion moment solution is equivalently transformed to be the solution of the axially averaged angular flux. Using the piecewise averaged angular flux at the top and bottom surfaces of 3D meshes, the planes are coupled to give the 3D angular flux distribution. The 3D CMFD linear system is established from the surface net current of every 3D pin-mesh to accelerate the convergence of power iteration. The STREAM code is extended to be capable of handling 3D problems based on the new approach. Several benchmarks are tested to verify its feasibility and accuracy, including the 3D homogeneous benchmarks and heterogeneous benchmarks. The computational sensitivity is discussed. The results show good accuracy in all tests. With the CMFD acceleration, the convergence is stable. In addition, a pin-cell problem with void gap is calculated. This shows the advantage compared to the traditional 2D/1D MOC methods.},

abstract = {Many deterministic neutron transport solvers rely on the source iteration method to solve the multi-group neutron transport equation. Often, these solvers rely on transport corrected cross-sections for accurate prediction of the neutron flux distribution. Transport corrected within-group scattering cross-sections can become negative, and if these negative cross-sections are large in magnitude, source iteration can become unstable and fail to converge for certain cases. In this study, we present evidence of this convergence issue for the method of characteristics (MOC) on full-core PWR problems with common transport correction schemes. A theoretical discussion is presented to illustrate the reason for the convergence issues. Previously established stabilization methods are compared with a newly proposed stabilization method. Results show that the new stabilization method allows for faster convergence than previous techniques. In addition, the effect of Coarse Mesh Finite Difference (CMFD) acceleration on stability is analyzed, showing that CMFD acceleration with full-group structure can overcome the convergence issues, but a stabilization technique is necessary for convergence when a condensed group structure is used.},

For simplicity, purely-sinusoidal reactivity oscillations are considered, although extensions to generic, periodic oscillations are immediate. It is shown how information on the long-term behavior of the system can be inferred by considering an equivalent algebraic problem, for which accurate approximations can be obtained very efficiently. As the procedure leads to reliable results even when low-order approximations are considered, this approach proves particularly convenient when the stability of the system has to be investigated over a large range of variation of the parameters characterizing the reactivity oscillations. Considerations about the asymptotic behavior of the system driven by a generic, periodic external source are also provided. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new transport theory method of characteristics direction probabilities (CDP), which can treat complicated geometries with computational efficiency, is presented. In the method, the entire problem is divided into subsystems or cells that are further subdivided into finer mesh regions (i.e., computational meshes). Within a subsystem or cell, the fine meshes are coupled by the directional transmission and collision probabilities for each characteristic direction. In other words, all fine meshes in a subsystem are not coupled together but only the fine meshes along the characteristic line are coupled for each direction. This is in contrast to the traditional collision probability methods (CPMs). To calculate the directional probabilities, ray tracing with the macroband concept is performed only on each subsystem type. To couple the subsystems, the angular flux (not the current as in the interface current method) on the interface between the adjacent subsystems is used. Therefore, the method combines the most desirable features of the discrete ordinates methods and those of the integral transport methods. To verify CDP, it is applied to two bench-mark problems that consist of complex meshes and is compared with other methods (CPM, method of characteristics, and Monte Carlo method). The results show that CDP gives accurate results with short computing time.},

Extensions to three dimensions have been attempted with mitigated success bringing into question the ability of performing efficient full core three-dimensional (3D) analysis. Although the 3D problem presents many computational difficulties, some simplifications can be made that allow for more efficient computation. In this investigation, we present SimpleMOC, a "mini-app" which mimics the computational performance of a full 3D MOC solver without involving the full physics perspective, allowing for a more straightforward analysis of the computational challenges. A variety of simplifications are implemented that are intended to increase the computational feasibility, including the formation axially-quadratic neutron sources. With the addition of the quadratic approximation to the neutron source, 3D MDC is cast as a CPU-intensive method with the potential for remarkable scalability on next generation computing architectures.},

abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to give some key points on the use of high performance computing (HPC) in the field of nuclear engineering. This chapter is divided into twomain parts. This first one is an introduction to parallel comput- ing. In this first part, we will describe not only themain computer and processor architectures which are used today but also some which are not so usual but which will allow the readers to better understand the key point of parallelism fromthe hardware point of view. Still in this first part, we will continue by describing the main parallelism models, in the same point of view as the description of the parallel architecture. In {\textgreater}Sect. 4, we will give some basic ideas on how to design parallel programs. This section is the last of the first part. The second part is dedicated to the use of high performance computing in nuclear engineering. We will give first the main challenges which can be addressed using HPC. Some of them are illustrated in {\textgreater}Sect. 6 on some of themain scientific domains in nuclear engineering (reactor physics, material sciences and thermal-hydraulic). For each of them we have tried to describe the main problems which can be addressed using HPC but some of them remain as scientific and industrial challenges.},

abstract = {The MPACT code, being developed collaboratively by the University of Michigan and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is the primary deterministic neutron transport solver being deployed within the Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications (VERA) as part of the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL). In many applications of the MPACT code, transport-corrected scattering has proven to be an obstacle in terms of stability, and considerable effort has been made to try to resolve the convergence issues that arise from it. Most of the convergence problems seem related to the transport-corrected cross sections, particularly when used in the 2D method of characteristics (MOC) solver, which is the focus of this work. In this paper, the stability and performance of the 2-D MOC solver in MPACT is evaluated for two iteration schemes: Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi. With the Gauss-Seidel approach, as the MOC solver loops over groups, it uses the flux solution from the previous group to construct the inscatter source for the next group. Alternatively, the Jacobi approach uses only the fluxes from the previous outer iteration to determine the inscatter source for each group. Consequently for the Jacobi iteration, the loop over groups can be moved from the outermost loop—as is the case with the Gauss-Seidel sweeper—to the innermost loop, allowing for a substantial increase in efficiency by minimizing the overhead of retrieving segment, region, and surface index information from the ray tracing data. Several test problems are assessed: (1) Babcock {\&} Wilcox 1810 Core I, (2) Dimple S01A-Sq, (3) VERA Progression Problem 5a, and (4) VERA Problem 2a. The Jacobi iteration exhibits better stability than Gauss-Seidel, allowing for converged solutions to be obtained over a much wider range of iteration control parameters. Additionally, the MOC solve time with the Jacobi approach is roughly 2.0–2.5× faster per sweep. While the performance and stability of the Jacobi iteration are substantially improved compared to the Gauss-Seidel iteration, it does yield a roughly 8–10{\%} increase in the overall memory requirement.},

@article{Wu2003,
abstract = {In this paper, we present recent developments based on a characteristics method applied for solving general 3D geometries in the case of isotropic boundary conditions. Assuming isotropic sources and scattering, this characteristics solver involves the calculation of the region-to-region angular flux by scanning the tracking file containing the integration lines. The scalar flux is computed by collecting all mean angular fluxes in terms of the entering angular flux and the source of the region. At the boundary, the entering angular fluxes are linked to the emerging angular fluxes by isotropic albedos. The transport solution is similar to the one obtained by the standard collision probability method. The main advantage of this treatment is to get rid of collision probability matrices which have a dimensionality of the size of the square of the number of regions. For multigroup calculations, the rebalancing scheme was enhanced to take into account the external currents for any value of the albedos. Numerical comparisons are also presented in order to show the accuracy of the characteristics method as compared to the standard collision probability treatment for 3D supercells in the lattice code DRAGON. Several calculations for the incremental cross sections of adjusters and liquid zone controllers show that the characteristics results are accurate for the usual supercell calculations in a CANDU reactor. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper we present the recent advances in MPACT for modeling Boiling Water Reactors. The new features of the VERA input are briefly described. The approach to the general geometry meshing algorithm is based on the use of planar graphs and algorithms for computing the minimum cycle basis of the graph. The visualization capability for the general geometry uses a Delauney triangulation algorithm to construct the mesh points for VTK. The BWR capability based on these algorithms allows for the modeling and analysis of (i) narrow and wide inter-assembly gaps, (ii) channel boxes with rounded corners, (iii) cruciform control blades. Models of Peach Bottom Unit 2 cycle 1 lattices are developed in VERA for MPACT and KENO models are developed to provide reference solutions. The solutions of the two codes are compared and the average of the differences over the 6 lattices had a $\Delta$k of 97 pcm for the unrodded cases and 199 pcm for the rodded cases. The average pin power RMS was 0.24{\%} and 0.28{\%} for the unrodded and rodded cases, respectively. The average maximum difference was 0.46{\%} for the unrodded cases and 0.90{\%} for the rodded case. The BWR capability is also demonstrated for a variety of problems including: a 3-D control cell of "GE-12 like" assemblies with a partially inserted control rod, and a 2-D whole-core beginning of life state for Peach Bottom Unit 2.},

abstract = {Within the framework of the OECD/NEA Expert Group on 3-D Radiation Transport Benchmarks, an international benchmark exercise for testing the ability of modern deterministic transport methods and codes to treat reactor problems without spatial homogenization was proposed in March 2001. That benchmark was completed in 2003 and the OECD report is available. As a follow-up to that benchmark, an extension of the 3-D calculations was proposed in May 2003 to provide a more challenging test of present day three-dimensional methods' ability to handle spatial homogeneities. Control rods were introduced, adding to the heterogeneity of the problems. The reactor core size was decreased to reduce the computational burden on all participants. Fourteen solutions were submitted for the new benchmark by 12 participants. All of the participant solutions were compared to a reference multigroup Monte Carlo solution. The analysis of results shows modern deterministic transport codes and methods can calculate the flux distribution reasonably well without relying upon spatial homogenization techniques, provided the domain size is small enough that the problem can be performed on available computing equipment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.},

The first stone standing ahead is the geometry modeling for pebble-bed district. In this work, a solid modeling method called constructive solid geometry (CSG) is introduced to model the pebble-bed district. A universal ray tracing technique is developed to arrange tracks in 3-D cylinder geometry. Furthermore, tree search method is implemented into MOCP to improve the ray tracing efficiency. Automatic meshing is implemented to improve the geometry modeling efficiency. A redundant tree was constructed to mesh the interspace among pebbles.

abstract = {In recent years a solver based on the Method of Characteristics (MOC) allowing the treatment of 3D extruded geometries has been developed inside the TDT code of APOLLO3. The standard Step Characteristics (SC) approximation is used and results show an excellent agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations. However a fine mesh refinement is needed to converge axially the strong flux gradients customarily appearing in 3D reactor physics applications. In this paper an improvement of this method is proposed: the results of the previous work show that much of the flux variations are likely to be represented by a polynomial basis along the vertical direction. Since most of the geometrical and physical heterogeneities are radially located, the SC approach is preserved to represent the solution over the radial plane. As a matter of fact the strong irregularities in the geometrical meshes prevent from an efficient use of a polynomial expansion. On the contrary along the axial direction the computational meshes assume a Cartesian shape, well suited for a polynomial representation of sources and fluxes. A convenient polynomial development in this direction allows us to approximate the strong flux slopes without the help of a large number of axial meshes. Finally we will show how synthetic accelerated results for the fourth generation fast breeder reactor ASTRID perform with respect to computational time, memory efficiency and precision against Monte-Carlo calculations. We will consider assembly geometries that span the full-height of the reactor and that are characterized by the strong heterogeneity conceived to enhance the axial leakage which improves the safety features of this new concept, especially under void conditions.},

This paper presents a modular ray tracing technique to reduce the amount of the ray tracing data and consequently reduce the memory. In this method, the object geometry is dissected into many cuboid cells by a background mesh. Typical geometric cells are picked out and ray traced, and only the ray tracing data in these typical cells is stored. Furthermore, the Coarse Mesh Finite Difference (CMFD) acceleration method is employed to save computing time. Numerical results demonstrate that the modular ray tracing technique can significantly reduce the amount of ray tracing data, and the CMFD acceleration is effective in shorting the computing time. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Mohanakrishnan1981,
abstract = {It has been recognized recently that accurate numerical solutions of the neutron transport equation in two dimensions can be obtained by interface current approach provided the angular dependence of these currents is properly accounted for. When this method is applied to the analysis of two-dimensional lattice unit cells found in thermal reactors it has the potential of providing the neutron distribution in such assemblies at lesser computing cost than other popular neutron transport theory methods like SN method and first flight collision probability method. Developments in the field of interface current approach to neutron transport are reviewed in the paper. Considering PN half-space expansion of angular currents at region interfaces and using the weighted residual (Bubnov-Galerkin) method, the interface current equations are formulated. Making use of the superposition principle of neutron currents, the approach to the solution of the system of equations so generated is indicated. Connections and differences with the response matrix method, where the currents at interfaces are similarly expanded, are explained. {\textcopyright} 1981.},
